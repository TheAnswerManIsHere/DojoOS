/**
 * The small shared module: this repository's machinery configuration, and the
 * dependency-free schema validator both dispatched roles answer through.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Until the #89 cut these helpers lived inside
 * `review-budget.mjs`, so every script that needed to know which repository it
 * was in imported the review-round budget to find out. When the budget was
 * removed the helpers had no home, and fourteen import sites pointed at a file
 * that was leaving. They are neutral — they decide nothing about a review loop
 * — so they became their own module rather than being rehoused in whichever
 * surviving script happened to be largest.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS HERE. Two things, and they share the property of being read by
 * more than one caller while deciding nothing on their own: the configuration
 * every script needs to name its repository and resolve a model tier, and the
 * validator every structured answer is checked against. Nothing that rules on
 * a finding, counts a round, or gates a merge — that machinery is gone, and
 * this module is not where it grows back.

 * The root of the repository this machinery governs: the nearest enclosing

 *
 * WHY NOT `dirname(script)/..`, WHICH THIS REPLACES. That form assumes the
 * scripts sit exactly one level below the root. True in a consumer, where the
 * sync lands them at `<repo>/scripts/`; false in the handbook, where they are
 * payload at `<repo>/core/scripts/` and `..` is `core/`. So the handbook read
 * a configuration that is not there -- `core/.agents/machinery.json` does not
 * exist -- and wrote its artifacts INSIDE its own payload, where a sync would
 * carry one repository's history to every other.
 *
 * THE MARKER IS THE CONFIGURATION ITSELF, because "which root?" and "whose
 * configuration?" have to have one answer. Any other marker can disagree with
 * the file that declares identity, and a root disagreeing with its own
 * configuration is the bug being replaced, not a variant of it.
 *
 * BOUNDED BY THE ENCLOSING REPOSITORY. The walk stops at a `.git`, so a
 * checkout that declares nothing fails closed with `machineryConfig`'s own
 * message instead of silently binding to a PARENT directory's configuration
 * -- a wrong-repo mistake in its most confusing form, since every artifact
 * would then be stamped with a repository the operator never chose.
 *
 * TOTAL BY CONSTRUCTION: it cannot throw. `existsSync` reports false rather
 * than raising, and an unfound marker falls back to the previous resolution,
 * so an unconfigured checkout behaves exactly as it did and fails with the
 * same message.
 *
 * A CONSUMER SEES NO CHANGE. From `<repo>/scripts`, the first directory up
 * carrying `.agents/machinery.json` is `<repo>` -- the answer `..` gave.

/**
 * One `codex exec` run.
 *
 * Every flag here is load-bearing:
 *   -                        the prompt arrives on stdin. `codex exec` waits
 *                            forever on an open stdin in this harness, so the
 *                            stream is written and closed, never inherited.
 *   --output-last-message    writes that message to a file, so the result is
 *                            read from disk rather than scraped out of a
 *                            transcript that contains 45 tool calls.
 *   --sandbox read-only      the reviewer reads the repo and cannot change it.
 *                            (It also blocks /tmp — a reviewer that must run
 *                            the suite needs workspace-write on a scratch
 *                            checkout, or a TMPDIR inside the workspace.)
 *   --ignore-user-config     a stray ~/.codex/config.toml must not steer this
 *                            reviewer -- its model, its sandbox or its tools.
 *                            Auth still comes from CODEX_HOME.
 *   --ignore-rules           same reasoning for execpolicy .rules files.
 *   --ephemeral              no session file on disk; each round is a fresh
 *                            context by construction, not by convention.
 *
 * stdout and stderr are inherited so a long run shows progress where a human
 * or a log file can see it; the answer never comes from either stream.
