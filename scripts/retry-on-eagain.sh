# SYNCED FROM AI-Handbook — do not edit in a consumer repo. Local edits are overwritten by the next sync and their reasoning is lost; change the handbook instead.
# retry-on-eagain.sh — run a command and retry up to N times if it fails with
# the specific "Resource temporarily unavailable" / EAGAIN error that node
# (and its child processes via pnpm) throws when the cgroup pid limit is
# saturated under heavy parallel validation load (typecheck +
# sentry-tests + api-server-tests + db-tests all racing to spawn tsx ESM
# loader workers and tsc / vitest helper processes at the same time).
#
# We only retry when the captured combined output contains the EAGAIN
# signature so we never paper over a real test failure.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/retry-on-eagain.sh <max-attempts> <cmd> [args...]
