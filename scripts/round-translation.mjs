/**
 * David's reading surface for the round translation: a message in chat. That is the whole surface.
 *
 * THERE IS NO PAGE, AND REMOVING IT WAS THE POINT (David, 2026-09-16, on #109
 * round 3). This module used to render an HTML page, write it to a gitignored
 * path, and hand back a relative filename -- so the "delivery" was a file
 * nobody could open, and the contract's "page link posted on the PR" described
 * a link that never existed. Three of that round's four findings were the
 * inside of that hole: no receipt producer, no deploy step, no synchronisation.
 * David's ruling, verbatim in substance: he lives in the chat, a page is
 * something he would have to go and copy-paste into a browser, and building a
 * delivery system for what is fundamentally one agent telling him the answer
 * would be undoing the #89 cut by hand. So: `chatReport` and nothing else.
 *
 * WHAT SURVIVES IS THE ONE PROPERTY WORTH MACHINERY. The translator's account
 * reaches David unedited: `chatReport` composes it from the validated answer's
 * own fields, verbatim, and I paste that. That is why the report is a function
 * rather than an instruction to me to "explain the round". It is a SECOND
 * account, not a ban on the builder's -- David ruled (2026-09-16) that a
 * builder-written account beside it is "not an issue at all", so the only
 * thing this module guards is that the translator's words are not mine.
 *
 * NO STATE SURVIVES A SESSION, AND NOTHING HERE NEEDS IT TO. The receipt store
 * went with the page, and round 4 found it had been silently carrying the
 * round's coordinates: with it gone, a resumed session had no lower bound for
 * the review window and no previous head, and `roundBrief`'s "from the start"
 * arm re-attributed every earlier round to the current one. The answer is not
 * a smaller store. Every coordinate a round needs is DERIVABLE from the pull
 * request itself: the reviewer marks each round it returns -- a formal review
 * submission when it has findings, a `**Reviewed commit:**` issue comment when
 * it has none (measured on #115, 2026-09-16) -- and those markers carry both
 * the timestamp and the reviewed commit. So the translator locates the round's
 * marker and the previous round's, and both the activity window and the
 * commit ranges follow. The caller pins two things only: the HEAD where the
 * evidence stops, and the UNTIL moment the dispatch was made. (Codex, #109
 * round 4; Astra and Fable passes, 2026-09-16.)
 *
 * THREE FACTS, NOT A LEDGER. The verdict line reads exactly three things off
 * the answer: were there disagreements, how many, and was anything left
 * unassessed -- and a fourth that gates the favourable line: did the translator
 * see a builder reply at all. There is no per-finding reconciliation and
 * nothing refuses a translation that skipped a finding -- the reader is a human
 * reading prose, and a paragraph missing a finding is a paragraph missing a
 * finding (David, 2026-09-12).
 *
 * The one rule the verdict obeys: **"agrees" is never printed over an
 * unassessed item, or over a round the builder has not answered.**
 * Could-not-observe is not the favourable answer, and neither is
 * nobody-said-anything-yet. And every place the report asserts a fact about the
 * round -- the verdict line, a section heading, an empty-list label -- reads
 * the SAME fact, because this component has paid four times for two claim
 * sites disagreeing (#81 round 8; #109 rounds 2, 3 and 4).
