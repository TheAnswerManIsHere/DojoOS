/**
 * The skill's own recipe text, RUN.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Three times in one pull request a documented recipe in
 * `plan-review-loop/SKILL.md` could not run at the moment it was meant to run:
 * the round-1 assess recipe refused on a missing ledger (#124 `4043982586`),
 * the pre-draft recipe demanded a plan that does not exist yet (`4043982594`),
 * and the correction for THAT one used `$S` eighty-eight lines before anything
 * assigns it (`4044552651`'s round, `4044735116`). Every one was caught by a
 * full Codex round plus two assessments plus a commit -- the most expensive
 * detector available -- and every one would have been caught by typing the
 * command. The script was thoroughly tested; the sentence telling an agent how
 * to reach the script was not tested at all.
 *
 * IT READS THE REAL FILE, because a test that transcribed the recipes would be
 * another statement of them, and would drift from the file it claims to check.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, and this list is load-bearing rather than modest --
 * a check advertised as "the recipes are verified" would earn back the overclaim
 * finding this same pull request already paid for:
 *
 *   1. THE DETACHED WRAPPER IS NOT RUN. `setsid nohup bash -c "..."`, the
 *      redirects, the `rm -f` of the marker and the exit file are stripped; only
 *      the `node` invocation inside survives.
 *   2. NO EXCHANGE IS SPAWNED. Every recipe that is not already `--prompt-only`
 *      gets `--dry-run` appended -- including the foreground scope exchange,
 *      which is otherwise a real ten-minute run. Both modes return before the
 *      sign-in check, so nothing here says an exchange would succeed; what is
 *      checked is that the invocation is accepted and composes its package.
 *   3. THE PLACEHOLDER VALUES ARE MINE, not an agent's. `<slug>`, `<N>`,
 *      `<tier>` and `<file>` are substituted from the table below. A recipe that
 *      only fails on some other value is not covered.
 *
 * BOTH PAYLOAD LAYOUTS ARE RUN, and until #124 round 8 only one was. The sync
 * routes `core/X -> X`, so the payload sits at `core/scripts/...` here and at
 * `scripts/...` in every consumer -- and the consumer layout is the one every
 * repository except this one actually runs. The fixture built only the
 * handbook's, so two consumer-only mechanisms were documented and never
 * executed: the `P=` line's `[ -f "$P" ] || P=scripts/plan-review.mjs` fallback
 * (`SKILL.md:23`), and `readVerbatim`'s consumer-first candidate, which tries
 * `docs/ai-context/...` before retrying under `core/`. `LAYOUTS` below runs
 * every recipe under both, which is what David asked for when he said the
 * check should cover the other repositories.
 *
 * WHAT THE FIXTURE SUPPLIES, and why the line is where it is. Only what the
 * skill tells an agent to create: the oracle (the scope-of-work gate says to
 * write it), the plan (the drafting step), the concern ledger (written after
 * every exchange), and the question file (the discussion recipe). Repository
 * configuration the checkout always has -- the contract, the Worth rule,
 * `.agents/machinery.json` -- is supplied too. It does NOT export `S` or `P`:
 * supplying those would conceal exactly the class this check exists for. The two
 * artifacts the SCRIPT produces rather than the agent -- an accepted assessment
 * and its plan snapshot -- are seeded for the discussion case, because a dry run
 * cannot produce them, and they are the one thing here staged rather than
 * earned.
 *
 * `bash --noprofile --norc -u` is what turns an unassigned variable into a
 * failure instead of an empty string, which is the mechanism of `4044735116`.
 *
 * IT CATCHES ALL THREE, which is why it is worth more than a fix. Measured by
 * reverting each one and watching this check go red, rather than by reasoning:
 *
 *   `$S` restored at :45      -> `bash: line 2: S: unbound variable`
 *   the assess form at :45    -> `--plan docs/plans/PLAN_RECIPES.md does not exist`
 *   the ledger not written    -> `no concern ledger at .agents/reviews/recipes/
 *                                concerns.json, and exchange(s) 0 already ran`
 *
 * THE LAYOUT SPLIT IS MEASURED THE SAME WAY, once per consumer-only mechanism,
 * and the discriminating result is that the handbook half stays green -- a
 * check that went all-red would not have told us which half it was exercising:
 *
 *   `readVerbatim`'s consumer candidate removed  -> 5 consumer cases fail,
 *                                                   5 handbook cases pass
 *   the `P=` fallback removed from SKILL.md:23   -> 5 consumer cases fail,
 *                                                   5 handbook cases pass
 *
 * The third is reached by changing the fixture rather than the document, which
 * is the honest shape of that one: the staging is authored here, so it holds
 * only while someone keeps it in step with the instructions.
