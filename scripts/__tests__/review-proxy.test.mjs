// SYNCED FROM AI-Handbook — do not edit in a consumer repo.
/**
 * The review proxy's tests, rewritten for the advisory model (#96, 2026-09-17).
 *
 * WHAT THE OLD SUITE TESTED AND WHY IT IS GONE. It asserted that a JSON answer
 * could not be internally incoherent -- a decline carrying a fix, a "finish"
 * leaving a question unanswered, an outcome contradicting its dispositions.
 * Those tests were correct about the design they guarded, and the design is
 * replaced: nothing is binding, nothing is parsed, and the assessment is prose.
 * Three consecutive rounds each found a new way for that JSON to contradict
 * itself, which is what a validator built by enumerating forbidden combinations
 * does. Removing the field removed the class.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE TESTS INSTEAD. The properties the oracle actually names: both
 * assessors get the same package; the instructions David reviewed are the ones
 * that run; the assessment reaches him unedited; the dispatch refuses to assess
 * a revision the checkout is not at; a follow-up costs no commit and no review
 * round; and nothing an assessor writes can authorise work.
