/**
 * One exchange of the in-session planning loop: two peers, one contract, and a
 * plan that never leaves this container.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, AFTER THE 2026-09-18 REDESIGN. Astra and I develop the plan
 * together. Astra reads the plan, the agreed oracle and the open concerns, and
 * writes Markdown. I argue where I disagree, investigate the facts myself, and
 * then say what happens next in an explicit `plan-action` block. **Nothing
 * parses an assessment.** No phrase in one can authorise work, and agreement
 * between the two of us never substitutes for David's approval.
 *
 * WHAT IT REPLACED, AND WHY. The first version had Astra return JSON against a
 * ten-section schema; this file validated it, refused it if it failed to
 * reconcile a prior finding, and computed `convergence` from its fields, which
 * the skill's stop rule then read. That made Astra's returned verdict the thing
 * driving the loop. David replaced that design after working through it with
 * Astra: the two of us are peers, the response is prose, and the next action is
 * stated rather than derived.
 *
 * SO THERE IS NO SCHEMA HERE, DELIBERATELY, and no re-ask: the substantive
 * output is Markdown because a person reads it, and there is nothing to
 * validate prose against. What survives from the old file is every piece of
 * machinery that protects something other than a verdict -- the oracle pin, the
 * publication refusals, the plan-drift refusal, the reviewer pin -- and those
 * are load-bearing for reasons recorded beside each one.
 *
 * ONE CONTRACT, TWO ROLES (David, 2026-09-18). `planning-contract.md` is
 * role-neutral and read verbatim by both parties. The facts that differ by role
 * -- who holds the plan, who settles a purely technical tie, where the output
 * goes -- are emitted by `roleBlock` and never left for either party to infer.
 * Both parties must receive the same words, or a difference between two
 * readings is a difference of briefing rather than of judgement. `--role claude
 * --prompt-only` is how I get my own copy.
 *
 * CONTINUITY LIVES IN A LEDGER, NOT IN THE ANSWER. Concerns cross exchanges in
 * `concerns.json` with their reasoning intact, each entry naming the assessment
 * file it came from, so the original argument can be read rather than
 * reconstructed from my summary of it. Open concerns, concerns waiting on
 * David, and any concern a discussion selects render in full; the rest render
 * as one line by reference.
 *
 * USAGE  (`--help` prints these with the path THIS checkout actually has:
 *         `core/scripts/...` in the handbook, `scripts/...` in a consumer)
 * -----
 *   # The scope exchange, before a plan exists: the oracle alone.
 *   node <this file> --kind scope --slug <slug> --oracle <file>
 *
 *   # An assessment of the plan as it now stands.
 *   node <this file> --kind assess --round 1 --tier internal --plan docs/plans/PLAN_X.md
 *
 *   # A focused discussion: no plan edit, no new round, no new assessment.
 *   node <this file> --kind discuss --round 1 --discussion 1 --tier internal \
 *        --plan docs/plans/PLAN_X.md --concerns C2,C5 --question "<the question>"
 *
 *   # My own copy of the same package. TWO FORMS, and the assess one is not
 *   # usable before a plan exists -- which is how the skill's recipe failed
 *   # twice (#124 rounds 1 and 3). Corrected there and, until round 3, not here.
 *   node <this file> --kind scope --slug <slug> --oracle <file> \
 *        --role claude --prompt-only            # before drafting
 *   node <this file> --kind assess --round 1 --tier internal --plan <file> \
 *        --role claude --prompt-only            # once a plan is written
 *
 *   --dry-run  assembles the prompt, writes it, spawns nothing.
 *
 * An exchange is ~9-10 minutes at xhigh (522 s hand-run, 576 s scripted), which
 * is longer than a comfortable Bash tool call. RUN IT DETACHED -- `setsid nohup`
 * with an exit file to wait on; a foreground run that gets cut off loses the
 * exchange, Astra's work included. The skill carries the exact shape.
 *
 * Output: .agents/reviews/<slug>/round-N.md (the assessment), or
 * round-N.discussion-M.md, plus the prompt, the meta and a snapshot of the plan
 * that was actually read. The whole directory is gitignored -- these are session
 * artifacts, and the plan is deliberately not published into git history.
 *
 * EXIT CODES
 *   0  an assessment was written
 *   1  a refusal, or the exchange failed
 *   2  no ChatGPT sign-in in this container -- David has to approve one
