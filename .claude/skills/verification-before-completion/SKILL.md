# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

## Scope: this is a truthfulness rule, not a "verify more" rule

**Local calibration for Opus 5 (fleet, 2026-07-24).** Opus 5 already
verifies its own work without being told to, and instructions that tell it to
verify produce redundant re-checking with no gain in correctness. This skill is
deliberately **not** that instruction. Read it as governing *what you may
claim*, never as a mandate to add verification work.

| This skill DOES require | This skill does NOT require |
|---|---|
| Running the command before claiming its result | Running it a second time to be sure |
| Reporting failures with the actual output | Adding a verification step to a task that didn't ask for one |
| Saying plainly when a step was skipped | Re-auditing work you already verified this session |
| Checking a delegated task actually landed | Spawning a subagent whose job is to double-check you |

The failure this exists to prevent is a *false claim of completion* — David
cannot read diffs, so my word that something works is the only signal he has
before UAT. It does not exist to make me cautious, slow, or repetitive. When in
doubt: verify once, report honestly, move on.

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming a task, fix, or verification status is complete or correct
(not before ordinary acknowledgment or a non-completion positive remark —
see Scope above):

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying
```

## Common Failures

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |
| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified | Test passes once |
| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports "success" |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |

## Red Flags - STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction that implies a completion or correctness claim before
  verification ("Great, that's fixed!", "Perfect, tests pass", "Done!") — plain
  acknowledgment with no completion claim ("Great, moving on to the next one")
  is not gated (see Scope above)
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"
- Tired and wanting work over
- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Should work now" | RUN the verification |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence ≠ evidence |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Linter passed" | Linter ≠ compiler |
| "Agent said success" | Verify independently |
| "I'm tired" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |
| "Different words so rule doesn't apply" | Spirit over letter |

## Key Patterns

**Tests:**
```
✅ [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] "All tests pass"
❌ "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**
```
✅ Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)
❌ "I've written a regression test" (without red-green verification)
```

**Build:**
```
✅ [Run build] [See: exit 0] "Build passes"
❌ "Linter passed" (linter doesn't check compilation)
```

**Requirements:**
```
✅ Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion
❌ "Tests pass, phase complete"
```

**Agent delegation:**
```
✅ Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state
❌ Trust agent report
```

## Why This Matters

From 24 failure memories:
- your human partner said "I don't believe you" - trust broken
- Undefined functions shipped - would crash
- Missing requirements shipped - incomplete features
- Time wasted on false completion → redirect → rework
- Violates: "Honesty is a core value. If you lie, you'll be replaced."

## When To Apply

**ALWAYS before:**
- ANY variation of success/completion claims
- Committing, PR creation, task completion
- Reporting a delegated task as done (check the diff, don't trust the report)

**NOT a trigger** (per the scope table above — these caused over-verification):
- Ordinary positive statements that aren't completion claims
- Moving to the next task in a plan, when nothing is being claimed complete
- Dispatching a subagent — brief it well; don't pre-verify to prepare for it

**Rule applies to:**
- Exact phrases
- Paraphrases and synonyms
- Implications of success
- ANY communication suggesting completion/correctness

## The Bottom Line

**No shortcuts for verification.**

Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.

This is non-negotiable.
