# Vendored / externally-installed skills

Claude Code on the web doesn't support `/plugin` marketplace commands, so
external skills are pulled in either by copying skill files directly into
`.claude/skills/` (which Claude Code auto-discovers, no plugin system
needed) or via the `npx skills@latest` CLI, which does the same thing
non-interactively. This file tracks provenance/licensing for each.

## Vendored skills from trailofbits/skills (CC BY-SA 4.0)

The following skill directories (and two agents under `.claude/agents/`) were
copied verbatim from https://github.com/trailofbits/skills, which is licensed
under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0):

- `differential-review` (+ agent `adversarial-modeler`)
- `insecure-defaults`
- `supply-chain-risk-auditor`
- `semgrep` (+ agent `semgrep-scanner`)
- `sarif-parsing`
- `fp-check`
- `agentic-actions-auditor`

Vendored instead of installed as a Claude Code plugin because plugin
marketplace commands (`/plugin`) aren't available in Claude Code on the web —
skills placed under a project's `.claude/skills/` folder are auto-discovered
without that step.

Only change made to upstream content: `semgrep`'s SKILL.md, scan-workflow.md,
and scanner-task-prompt.md referenced the plugin-namespaced subagent type
`static-analysis:semgrep-scanner`; rewritten to the plain `semgrep-scanner`
since project-level agents in `.claude/agents/` aren't plugin-namespaced.

Not vendored (referenced by these skills but out of scope for this pass):
`codeql` and `sarif-parsing`'s sibling `audit-context-building` / `issue-writer`
skills. Each of the above still works standalone without them.

## Vendored skills from obra/superpowers (MIT)

All 14 skills under `skills/` from https://github.com/obra/superpowers were
copied verbatim into `.claude/skills/`: `brainstorming`,
`dispatching-parallel-agents`, `executing-plans`,
`finishing-a-development-branch`, `receiving-code-review`,
`requesting-code-review`, `subagent-driven-development`,
`systematic-debugging`, `test-driven-development`, `using-git-worktrees`,
`using-superpowers`, `verification-before-completion`, `writing-plans`,
`writing-skills`. MIT licensed, copyright Jesse Vincent.

**Local modifications (2026-07-24) — these three are no longer verbatim.** All
three were tuned for a model generation that *under*-delegated and *under*-
verified; Opus 5 has the opposite bias, so each gained a clearly-marked local
calibration block. Upstream content is otherwise untouched, and each block is
labelled so a future re-vendor can spot and re-apply it:

- `verification-before-completion` — added a **Scope** section ("truthfulness
  rule, not a verify-more rule") and narrowed the *When To Apply* triggers.
  Keeps the Iron Law; drops the framing that made every positive statement a
  verification gate.
- `dispatching-parallel-agents` — added a **Local calibration** section capping
  delegation (do it yourself under ~a handful of tool calls, prefer one agent to
  several, 20-agent ceiling, announce expensive-model dispatches).
- `subagent-driven-development` — added a **Local calibration** paragraph
  limiting fan-out to substantial independent tasks.

**Further local modifications (2026-09-20), from the cold-reader sweep for the
two-review limit.** Upstream's review guidance is unbounded by design — review
early and often, fix and carry on — which contradicts a fleet rule that ends
autonomous iteration at two reviews on work that is internal by the
consequence and recoverability of the change
([`working-modes.md`](../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#the-two-review-limit-on-autonomous-iteration-david-2026-09-19)).
(Not on everything: the limit is scoped, and this sentence stated it unscoped
until 2026-09-23.) Each is a clearly-marked block, same
convention as above:

- `requesting-code-review` and `receiving-code-review` — added a **Local
  calibration** block naming the two-review limit and its home, and calling out
  the two upstream habits that are wrong here: fixing findings one at a time
  instead of batching them, and applying fixes with no review of what was
  written.
- `requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md` — the "With fixes" merge verdict
  now says the corrected head still gets its own review.
- `subagent-driven-development` — the final whole-branch fix wave now gets a
  review before the branch is finished; the flow previously ran it straight
  into `finishing-a-development-branch`.

Rationale and the full policy for the 2026-07-24 delegation calibrations live
in `CLAUDE.md` → *Model, cost, and routing*; the two-review limit's are in its
home, linked above.
MIT permits modification; attribution above is unchanged.

Not vendored: the plugin's `hooks/` (a SessionStart hook that auto-loads
skill docs at session start) — this repo already has its own SessionStart
hook (test DB setup) and adding a second one wasn't part of the ask. The
skills work standalone without it; the model just decides whether to invoke
them by description match, same as any other project skill.

Requested as `superpowers@claude-plugins-official` — that marketplace alias
wasn't resolved; vendored directly from the plugin's authoritative upstream
source (`obra/superpowers`) instead, which is the same underlying content.

## Installed via `npx skills@latest` (mattpocock/skills, MIT)

`grill-me` — installed at project scope via the real `skills` CLI
(`npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills -s grill-me -a claude-code -y`),
which writes `skills-lock.json` at the repo root for future
`npx skills update` / `experimental_install`. MIT licensed, copyright Matt
Pocock. Note: the user's first attempt used `-g` (global, user-home-level)
install — that does not persist in this ephemeral remote environment, so it
was reinstalled at project scope instead so it's committed with the rest.

## Vendored skills from mattpocock/skills (MIT) — file copy, 2026-08-21

`grilling`, `domain-modeling`, and `prototype` were copied from a fresh clone
of https://github.com/mattpocock/skills (main branch as of 2026-08-21, MIT
licensed, copyright Matt Pocock) via direct file copy — NOT via the `skills`
CLI, so `skills-lock.json` does not track them (it covers only the
CLI-installed `grill-me`). PR #545, workstream #544. Upstream locations:
`skills/productivity/grilling/`, `skills/engineering/domain-modeling/`,
`skills/engineering/prototype/`. The upstream `agents/openai.yaml` files
(OpenAI-harness display metadata) were deliberately not vendored.

Modification status:

- `grilling/SKILL.md` — upstream body verbatim, plus a clearly-marked
  "Local adaptations" section (interviewee, terse question bodies,
  notification rule, delegation caps, ceremony boundary, and since #166 one
  question per turn in place of upstream's whole-frontier rounds).
- `domain-modeling/SKILL.md` — **adapted, not verbatim**: upstream's session
  behaviors and three-gate offer heuristic kept; file targets rewritten from
  `CONTEXT.md`/`docs/adr/` to `docs/ai-context/glossary.md` and
  `docs/ai-context/decisions.md`; upstream's `CONTEXT-FORMAT.md` and
  `ADR-FORMAT.md` not vendored (the target files carry their own formats).
- `prototype/SKILL.md` — upstream body verbatim plus a "Local adaptations"
  section that **replaces upstream's delivery and capture mechanics** (as of
  #168; the rule is `working-modes.md` *The prototype phase, per feature*):
  a prototype is a feature in prototype phase inside the product,
  delivered as the published product or a prototype environment, with a
  questions file, a feedback rail stored in the product's database, a tester
  tier, and a per-feature phase registry; upstream's Artifact/double-click
  delivery, `?variant=` on production pages, hide-in-production switcher and
  draft-PR capture are named as not applying. `LOGIC.md` and `UI.md` are
  upstream copies plus one local note under each title (#168 round 4's
  sweep: a reader of either file alone was still told to gate the switcher
  on `NODE_ENV` and capture the prototype on a throwaway branch) saying
  which of their mechanics `SKILL.md` replaces; their upstream text is not
  otherwise edited. The same sweep put a one-paragraph local note under the
  title of `brainstorming/SKILL.md` and `test-driven-development/SKILL.md`,
  saying a prototype-phase feature does not pass their gates (corrected by
  #173: a first version passes brainstorming's, as its pre-plan
  conversation; tests stay removed), and one under
  `using-superpowers/SKILL.md`'s subagent stop saying its phrase router
  runs after the registry read, and one under `systematic-debugging/SKILL.md`'s
  title, whose own description is a trigger the router note cannot reach,
  and under `writing-plans/SKILL.md`'s title for the same reason; upstream
  text below each note is untouched. #168's round-6 sweep added one more
  under `finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md`'s title, since its
  "exactly 4 options" menu has no option a prototype branch can take.
- `grill-me/SKILL.md` — **no longer verbatim as of PR #545**: body changed
  from `Run a `/grilling` session.` to upstream's exact delegation form,
  `Call the Skill tool with "grilling".` (it had pointed at a skill that was
  not installed).
