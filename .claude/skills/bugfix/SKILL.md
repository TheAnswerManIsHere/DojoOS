name: bugfix
description: Bug-fixing workflow — fix a bug without the planning ceremony. Use when David says /bugfix (the explicit override), or whenever a request is bugfix-shaped — a report that already-agreed behavior is broken, "just fix this", a defect with an observable symptom. Announce the classification in one line on entry; ask when it could really be a behavior change. One bug per branch per PR, opened as soon as the fix is verified. Drops the plan file and the plan-review loop; keeps (and tiers) verification — a Tier A/B fix carries a regression test, a blast-radius note, and a bugfix oracle in the PR body, while a trivial Tier C schema fix uses its own dedicated oracle block instead — and Codex still reviews the diff under the write-gate rule. Opposite of the default feature-building flow in CLAUDE.md.

Entry is **routed, announced, and vetoable (David, 2026-08-09 — replacing
explicit-only invocation).** I classify each work request by its shape:

- **Bugfix-shaped** — a report that already-agreed behavior is broken (an
  error, a wrong output, a defect with an observable symptom) → I enter this
  workflow and **announce it in one line** ("Treating this as a bugfix — tier
  after diagnosis; say the word if you want feature ceremony"). The
  announcement is David's veto surface: he pre-declares nothing, but always
  sees which contract is in force before code moves.
- **`/bugfix` is the explicit override** — it forces the light path when I'd
  otherwise hesitate. It is still a hypothesis, not a verdict: Tier C exits
  the workflow regardless of how it was entered.
- **Ambiguous** — the "bug" could really be a behavior change ("fix the
  ranking, it feels wrong") → one numbered question, per the pause-and-ask
  rule. No entry design settles these; they were always going to be asked.

**Classification is per-request — there is no sticky mode state.** "Here's
another one" is bugfix-shaped on its face and needs no re-invocation; a
feature-shaped request arriving mid-run simply gets the feature workflow
(announced, like every classification). What *does* recur per bug is the
branch discipline in step 1 — skipping it is how a second bug lands on the
first bug's already-pushed branch, silently breaking one-bug-per-PR.

**Never for a feature David has declared prototype phase.** A defect there is
the next version through the `prototype` skill, not a bugfix PR — nothing
about a prototype is agreed behaviour yet, and no review loop runs on it
([`working-modes.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#the-prototype-phase-per-feature-david-2026-09-26)). The registry is read
before this mode is entered.

**The one-line summary of what this mode is:** it drops the *planning* ceremony
(plan file, pre-plan conversation, the multi-round Codex plan-review loop), not
the *verification*. A small-looking fix can still have wide consequences, so the
verification scales to what diagnosis reveals the fix actually touches.

## 1. Before each bug — set up the branch

**This step runs once per bug, *before* diagnosing it — however the bug's
request arrived** (routed classification or explicit `/bugfix`). Check state
first: if the branch currently checked out already has a prior bug's fix
pushed to it (its PR is open or merged), that branch is spoken for — cut a
new one per below. Only skip this step if the current branch has no bug on
it yet (nothing committed).

One bug, one branch, one PR. Cut fresh from current `origin/main` (David
squash-merges, so a fresh base avoids phantom conflicts), with a **topic** slug:

```
git fetch origin main
# Topic slug, not a date: claude/bugfix-annual-plan-lookup
git checkout -b claude/bugfix-<topic> origin/main   # -b, never -B
```

**Never `-B`.** `-B` *resets* the ref to `origin/main`, which would silently wipe
an existing same-named branch's unpushed work. If `-b` fails because the name
exists, that is the signal to pick a different slug — never fall back to `-B`,
`--force`, or any reset. (A GitHub ruleset blocks force pushes on `claude/**`,
so the push would be refused anyway; the local reset it would follow is what
loses the work. See CLAUDE.md's *This environment's git constraints*.)

> **The assigned-branch exception is scoped to an *unclaimed* branch.** If I was
> invoked on a designated working branch and it has no bug on it yet, **stay on
> it** — the fresh-branch step is for the normal case where David starts a bug
> from scratch. But the "spoken for" check above still applies on every bug: the
> moment that assigned branch carries a prior bug's pushed fix, it's claimed the
> same as any other branch, and this exception no longer covers it. If the
> environment also disallows creating a fresh branch (a runner that assigned
> exactly one branch), don't put the second bug on the first bug's branch to
> route around that — stop and ask David for a new assigned branch instead.

**A bug arriving mid-feature-build doesn't touch the feature's working tree
(David, 2026-08-09).** With routed entry, bug reports can land while a
feature branch has in-flight work. Don't stash-juggle the feature state: run
the bugfix in an isolated worktree (`EnterWorktree`, branched from
`origin/main` per above) or say plainly that a fresh session is cleaner and
let David choose — either way the feature tree comes back untouched.

Then confirm the branch name (the classification announcement at entry
already named the workflow).

**Workstream issue.** The disclosure check that gates opening it is a
shared-contract requirement now
([`working-modes.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#disclosure-check-before-the-workstream-issue-opens)'s
*Disclosure check, before the workstream issue opens*), not Claude-specific
— I run it, but I don't restate the *why* here.

For everything else: per `workstream-tracking.md`, bugfix mode branches
straight from Discovery to Coding, skipping Planning and Plan approval. If
David's bug report doesn't already have a workstream issue, **check for a
backlog issue first** — a known, already-queued bug (`queue:` label) is
exactly this situation, David just decided to fix it now. Per
`workstream-tracking.md`'s *The backlog* section, promote a matching
backlog issue (drop `queue:`, add the labels below) rather than opening a
duplicate. Only when no backlog match exists does a genuinely new issue
open — **but only if the disclosure check above passed.** If it didn't, this is
where that matters mechanically, not just as a stated rule: open a private
draft Project item instead of a public issue, and say so plainly rather
than silently taking the fast path. When the check passed, open the public
issue with `stage:coding`, `waiting:claude`, `mode:bugfix` — one per bug,
matching the one-bug-per-branch-per-PR rule above — and give it a State of
Play block (per `workstream-tracking.md`) at the same time, not just
labels. From PR open onward, `pr-watch` owns the label transitions and the
block's upkeep.

**If this bug was found during UAT, record the way back up — in the same
edit, not later.** This is the single most common way a bug arrives here,
and the descent is what makes it dangerous: chasing it is usually right
pre-launch, but the interrupted UAT is what gets lost. Per
[`workstream-tracking.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/workstream-tracking.md)'s
*When UAT finds a bug*:

- Add `Blocked by: #<this bug>` to the **interrupted** workstream's issue
  body, and one line in its State of Play naming **which UAT step failed**
  — that's what turns resumption into "resume at step 4" rather than a full
  re-run.
- **Also flip the interrupted issue's `waiting:` label to `claude`**,
  recording its prior value (normally `david`, mid-UAT) in the same State
  of Play line. Left at `waiting:david`, `/status-all` — which doesn't
  parse `Blocked by:` and was deliberately left unchanged — keeps showing
  a mechanically non-actionable UAT under NEEDS YOU while the actual ask
  is the new bug, which is agent-held work. `waiting:claude` is accurate:
  a session needs to close this bug before David has anything to look at
  again.
- **If the interrupted workstream is a phase sub-issue, mirror the same
  flip onto its parent, in the same edit.** The parent's `waiting:`
  mirroring obligation (`pr-watch`, per `workstream-tracking.md`'s *Phased
  features*) only covers PR-driven toggles — this is an issue edit, not a
  PR one, so without this the parent sits at `waiting:david` for the whole
  descent while the phase correctly shows `waiting:claude`.
- Do it at intake, while the context is in front of me. A session that ends
  before this is written loses the link entirely; nothing reconstructs it.
- The chain nests if the fix hits its own blocker, and it pops on its own:
  closing this issue makes the interrupted UAT actionable again, and
  `/next` surfaces it as the top recommendation.
- **If diagnosis reveals this isn't a bug fix at all** but a real
  behavior change or a subsystem rebuild (the PR #213 → admin-permission
  shape), that's Tier C — leave bugfix mode per the classification rule.
  The `Blocked by:` link stays exactly as written; it doesn't care which
  mode the work ends up in.

## 2. Diagnose, classify, then fix

Follow the loop in
[`working-modes.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#per-bug--the-loop)
— root cause, **tier classification**, regression test first, smallest correct
fix, blast radius, verify, one commit.

**Step 1 of that loop asks whether the root cause is even in the repo.** Most
bugs, yes — read the code, write the failing test, done. But when a bug turns on
what the running system actually *contains*, the shared contract puts that
evidence in step 1, before the tier — the rule is cross-agent and lives there,
not here.

**This is my enactment of it.** When a bug is in that class, read
**[`live-diagnosis.md`](live-diagnosis.md)**: which source answers which
question (Sentry for what production threw, the Repl for live dev state, the
repo for what the code does), how to drive the connector so the answer is
evidence rather than the agent's account of itself, and what must be redacted
before any of it is quoted into a public artifact. It stays diagnosis — the fix
still goes branch → PR → Codex → merge.

**The classification is a real beat, not a formality.** I state the tier and the
reason out loud before writing the fix, because the tier decides what ships with
the PR. Tier A is the exception, by design.

**Model tier follows the classification (CLAUDE.md's *Model, cost, and routing*):**

- **Entering the bugfix workflow** (routed or via `/bugfix`) — **diagnose on
  whatever tier the session is on; ask for Opus before writing the fix**
  (David, 2026-08-28, superseding the 2026-08-15 constant-tier rule). The
  boundary is product code, and a bugfix crosses it: reproducing the symptom,
  reading the failing path and classifying the tier are all thinking, so a
  Fable session does them without ceremony — then names the boundary and asks
  for `/model claude-opus-5` before the first edit. **A Tier B fix never starts
  on Fable at all**, since it is Opus-reserved execution. Triage and
  diagnosis stay in my main loop. A **bounded** piece of the work — reproduce
  the symptom, find every caller of X — is eligible for a Sonnet subagent;
  the diagnosis itself is not, because it is stateful.
- **The moment I classify a fix as Tier B** — I say so, and what it now means
  is that the fix is **not eligible for subagent routing**: I write it myself,
  in my main loop. That is the whole point of the tier: these are the fixes
  where a subtle error slips both nets.
  - **This assumes the main loop is Opus — verify, don't assume (Codex,
    round 3).** A Tier B fix is Opus-reserved *execution*, and the contract
    requires me to write it myself, so it is not routable by construction.
    If the session is genuinely below Opus — an in-Repl session pinned to
    `sonnet`, or one still on `opusplan` until restart — **I stop and ask
    David to run this fix from an Opus session.** That is the one surviving
    switch ask, and it survives because the *work* is reserved, not because
    it's convenient. Executing a Tier B fix on Sonnet because "the contract
    says the session is Opus" is exactly the silent failure the tier guard
    exists to prevent.
- **Tier C** — stop and escalate to David; it isn't a bug fix, so this mode
  doesn't pick its model tier. Where it goes next does: non-trivial or
  behavior-changing Tier C work **restarts in feature mode**, which picks the
  tier there — but a genuinely **trivial database schema fix that David
  explicitly green-lights runs migration ceremony directly, without
  restarting anywhere** (see *When NOT to use this mode*), and that path is
  **Opus, always** per the tier table's migrations row, never the Sonnet
  triage tier it was diagnosed on.

## 3. Ship it — PR immediately, no waiting

As soon as the fix is verified, open the PR. **There is no "create the PR" gate
anymore** — batching is gone, so nothing is waiting to accumulate, and holding
the PR back only delays the review that catches things.

1. Push the **actual current branch** — `git push -u origin HEAD` (retry with
   backoff on network errors; never force-push). Don't hardcode the
   `claude/bugfix-<topic>` name here: on the normal path that *is* the current
   branch, but the preselected/assigned-branch exception in step 1 means the
   real name can differ, and pushing a literal wrong name either fails or
   targets an unrelated ref. The branch was cut from current `origin/main` and
   has never been pushed, so **no rebase is needed or wanted** — see CLAUDE.md's
   git constraints. If the branch later needs current `main`, **merge, don't
   rebase**.
2. Open the PR with `mcp__github__create_pull_request` — base `main`
   normally; **as a draft only when the Tier B draft-first flow in step 3
   applies** (a plain non-draft open is the point for everything else —
   round 1 fires immediately).
   **Exception: a stacked fix bases against its parent's branch, not `main`**
   (per `working-modes.md`'s *Dependent bugs* note) — otherwise the new PR's
   diff carries both bugs' commits until the parent merges, defeating the
   one-bug-per-PR isolation this whole redesign is for. **Retarget to `main`
   *before* the parent's PR is merged, not after** — this repo auto-deletes a
   merged branch with no reliable window afterward (deletion can happen as
   part of the merge itself), and a documented prior incident
   (recorded in the repo's own review-workflow notes)
   shows exactly this orphaning; that record's required workflow says to
   retarget before squash-merging, not after. Retargeting early leaves the
   diff temporarily broad (it still shows the parent's unmerged commits) —
   accept that, it's cosmetic. Once the parent has actually merged, narrow the
   diff: `git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main` into this branch
   (merge, never rebase, on an already-pushed branch), then push.
   Use **`.github/pull_request_template.md`** — the
   repo template applies to bug fixes too. Fill the **Approved-plan oracle**
   section with the **bugfix oracle** instead of "n/a — no plan" — **which
   block depends on the tier:**

   **The tier letter goes on the body's `Oracle source:` line**
   (`claude-core.md` Pull requests rule 4); everything else stays prose. The
   reason for the tier is its own required field, **`Tier rationale`**,
   because a reviewer uses it to challenge a mis-tiering and a bare letter
   cannot be challenged.

   **Tier A/B:**
   ````markdown
   Oracle source: bugfix, Tier <A or B>

   **Tier rationale:** <the Q1/Q2 triggers checked: which one fired (B), or
     which were ruled out (A) — a bare tier letter isn't enough; A is the
     classification a reviewer most needs to be able to challenge>
   **Reported symptom:** <David's report, quoted verbatim>
   **Intended correct behavior:** <what right looks like>
   **Must not change:** <adjacent behaviors sharing this code path>
   **Root cause:** <the mechanism, not the instance>
   **Blast radius:** <what else calls this / shares this path, and what I checked>
   ````

   **Tier C, trivial schema fix** (David authorized migration ceremony directly
   — a *different* block, not the one above):
   ````markdown
   Oracle source: bugfix, Tier C

   **Tier rationale:** trivial schema/migration fix, no plan
   **Reported symptom:** <David's report, quoted verbatim>
   **Root cause:** <the mechanism, not the instance>
   **Why this is trivial:** <single-step, no data transformation, no behavior
     change — the specific reason it didn't need a full plan>
   **David's go-ahead:** <how/when confirmed>
   **Migration ceremony checklist:** <idempotency, observable counts,
     human-edited-row preservation, rollback for destructive ops>
   ````

   Then **Verification** (exact commands + results, and the click-through steps
   to observe the fix), and the checklist.
3. **Tier B, product-visible fix — ship the UAT doc on this same PR.** The
   test is whether the fix has *any* product-visible behavior, not which
   Q1/Q2 trigger put it in Tier B — a fix whose only surface is internal
   (CI, build tooling, API-schema codegen with no frontend-visible type
   change) takes the **internal/infra-only exception**
   instead: a written verification note in the PR body, no UAT doc (see
   [`working-modes.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#tier-b--elevated-fix)).
   When a UAT doc is due, the filename needs the PR number, so the flow is
   **draft-first (David, 2026-08-09 — replacing the docs-pending +
   explicit-re-review dance, which bought a guaranteed second round for
   file-naming reasons):** open the PR **as a draft** (the number now
   exists, and a draft doesn't trigger the Codex connector), commit
   `docs/tests/UAT/PR<N>_<FEATURE>_UAT.md` with the PR body linking it, then
   **mark the PR ready for review** — round 1 fires once, on the complete
   diff, UAT included. **The connector documents this trigger itself:** its
   review boilerplate lists exactly three — "Open a pull request for
   review", **"Mark a draft as ready"**, and commenting `@codex review`
   (observed on PR #391, 2026-08-09). Still glance that round 1 actually
   lands on the first draft-first fix; if it somehow doesn't, post one
   explicit `@codex review` naming the full diff and correct this line.
   Write it to
   [`uat-doc-format.md`](../../../docs/tests/uat-doc-format.md) — the format
   is mandatory, and **not** "match the nearest surviving doc," which is how
   six competing conventions accumulated before it existed. **No Artifact
   page** (David, 2026-08-21 — retired; David works the doc through
   [`/uat`](../uat/SKILL.md) with me rather than reading it alone), and its
   setup lines are mine to execute, per `pr-docs`. The PR body's
   Post-merge verification section
   gets real content only if something genuinely needs Replit's
   environment — per
   [`test-run-contract.md`](../../../docs/tests/test-run-contract.md), it
   is not a default ("none needed" is the correct content otherwise; the
   standalone TEST_RUN file is retired, 2026-08-15). **Add the UAT doc
   link to
   the workstream issue's State of Play `Artifacts` field once committed** —
   the same instruction `pr-docs` follows for feature-mode UAT docs, so a
   cold-resumed session finds the doc regardless of which path produced it.
4. **Watch the PR** per CLAUDE.md's *Watching the PRs I open*:
   `subscribe_pr_activity` immediately, on whatever tier the session is on.
   **There is no model gate** (David, 2026-08-15 — the Sonnet gate this step
   used to carry is retired, along with the switch-ask it forced).

## 4. Drive the review under the write-gate rule

The review-loop contract is shared and enacted elsewhere — **the mechanics
live in the `pr-watch` skill** (which loads for any watched PR, bugfix or
feature) **and in
[`working-modes.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md)**: the tier of
what the fix touches (a statement of what is downstream — not a rubric
selector, and not a round budget), the **write-gate
rule — every round that returns findings gets two independent assessments
before anything is written for it, and any commit that does get written gets a
mandatory review round; the in-loop continue/stop, criticality gate, count
trend and oscillation diagnosis are all retired, and the external adjudicator
that used to rule per finding was replaced by the shared judgement (#96), which
advises rather than binds**, the
fix / accept-and-document / escalate triage stated per finding, the
class-sweep protocol (name the class, cite the mechanical oracle, sweep to
zero, re-run prior rounds' oracles before every push), resolving each thread
myself right after addressing it, bare-trigger re-requests with context in a
separate defanged comment, the cumulative-diff rule after 2+ fix rounds, and
unsubscribing at merge/close. **Pointer, not a copy** —
restating those mechanics here is how this section went stale once already
(it carried a "never resolve threads" rule for two months after David
reversed it, 2026-08-06).

What is *bugfix-specific* about the loop:

- **The review carries more weight here than in feature mode.** With no plan
  and (on Tier A) no UAT doc, Codex's diff review is the main net — and it
  has earned that: several entries in
  [`known-failure-patterns.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/known-failure-patterns.md)
  were caught by review *after* the shipped tests passed. Engage every
  round; the light *planning* path must never shade into a light *review*
  path.
- **Round 1 is automatic.** The Codex connector reviews on non-draft PR
  open — or on marking a draft ready, in the Tier B draft-first flow
  (step 3, with its first-use caveat) — so no `@codex review` on open.
- **The artifact the fix touches picks the tier — never the fact that it's
  a fix.** A fix to product code is a product loop. But routed entry means a
  bug can be *in the docs*: when the whole diff is agent-facing markdown or
  process tooling, the
  [two-review limit](../../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#the-two-review-limit-on-autonomous-iteration-david-2026-09-19)
  applies to a fix that is internal by its consequence and recoverability —
  the automatic pass, one coherent batch of corrections if any are warranted,
  and a review of that corrected head. It is scoped that way and not by the
  tier, so a fix to process tooling governing approvals, publication,
  credentials or destructive operations is weighed on both, and can fall
  outside it. This read "the internal tier
  governs (David, 2026-08-21) … the two-review limit, the same as everywhere"
  until 2026-09-23: the tier named as the classifier, and the limit named as
  universal, in one sentence that cited neither. The tier itself only says nobody's money or data is downstream,
  and leaves the judgement to
  [`review-judgment.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/review-judgment.md) — exactly
  as if the same change had arrived through feature mode. **This bullet used to
  say "where only a critical flaw is written for"**, which was the tier's
  retired decline quota and, on an internal bugfix, the only triage rule this
  skill stated. Entering through this mode never
  raises an artifact's ceremony, and never lowers product code's.
- **The re-reviewer's oracle is the bugfix oracle** (step 3), not a plan —
  it's what lets Codex ask "root cause or symptom-patch?" and "did this
  miss a caller?", so re-requests reference it the way feature loops
  reference the approved plan.

The reviewer's own standard is shared, not my ceremony:
[`code-review.md`](../../../docs/engineering/code-review.md#re-reviews-round-2-onward).

## When the next request isn't a bug

There is no mode to exit — classification is per-request. A feature-shaped
request ("let's build / add / change X") simply gets the feature workflow —
after the registry read at the top of this file, which sends a
prototype-phase feature to the `prototype` skill instead (where a first
version still plans) — and the
classification announcement makes the switch visible. Two cases
still deserve care:

- **A request that could be either** — a "fix" that might really mean
  re-designing the behavior — gets one numbered question, not a guess
  (the pause-and-ask rule,
  [`agent-working-rules.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/agent-working-rules.md#mid-build-ambiguity-pause-and-ask)):
  guessing wrong is expensive in both directions — either I skip a plan the
  work needed, or I pile ceremony onto a one-line fix.
- **Tier C** is the same call arriving from the other direction: the request
  looked bugfix-shaped, and *diagnosis* revealed it's really
  feature/migration work. Same escalation, different trigger.

Questions, status checks, and meta-discussion aren't work requests and get
no classification at all.

## When NOT to use this mode

A feature, a behavior change, **any *database* schema change, migration, or
backfill** (Tier C without exception, regardless of product consequence; not
generated API-validation schemas, which stay Q1 Tier B — see
[`working-modes.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#tier-c--this-is-not-a-bug-fix-leave-bugfix-mode)),
or anything where David needs to verify intent is out of the fast path — a
non-trivial one goes to **feature mode**, a genuinely trivial database schema
fix runs migration ceremony directly per Tier C, and one on a feature the
registry lists in prototype phase goes to the `prototype` skill. Don't use `/bugfix` to sneak a
feature through the fast path — and don't let a fix quietly become one
mid-build; that's Tier C.

**A "clean up the review findings" batch is not a bug fix either (David,
2026-08-09).** Leftover findings from earlier PRs are N separate defects,
and batching them recreates exactly what one-bug-per-PR banned — PR #334
(nominally a bugfix, actually eleven batched findings: 21 rounds, 69
findings, 72% self-inflicted, no breaker fired) is the measured cost. Each
real defect gets its own classification and its own PR.

When unsure, ask.
