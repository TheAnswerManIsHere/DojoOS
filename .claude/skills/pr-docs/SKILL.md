description: Use right after opening a feature-mode PR with product-visible or testable behavior, before calling that PR done. Bugfix-mode PRs do NOT inherit this pairing — their docs are conditional per tier — and neither does a prototype-phase PR, which ships neither half.

# Every production-phase feature PR ships post-merge verification + a UAT

Migrated out of `CLAUDE.md` so it loads when the docs are actually being
written. The rule that a product-visible feature PR is not complete until
both halves exist stays resident in `CLAUDE.md`.

### The pairing (David, 2026-08-15 — the standalone TEST_RUN file is retired)

**This section is the feature-mode default: paired by default, for a feature in production phase.**
Bugfix mode does **not** inherit this pairing — its verification is
conditional per tier, and its infra-only fixes may ship neither half: see
[`working-modes.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#tier-b--elevated-fix).
What follows describes the feature-mode default.

For **every** feature-mode PR that has product-visible or testable behavior
**and is in production phase**, I ship two things. A prototype-phase PR
ships neither: its feedback rail is its verification, and a UAT doc would be
the documentation bar the phase removes (working-modes.md, *The prototype
phase, per feature*).

1. **The PR body's *Post-merge verification* section** — the
   engineering checks for Replit's live environment (the technical safety
   net). This replaced the old `docs/tests/Replit/PR<N>_..._TEST_RUN.md`
   file (David, 2026-08-15): the checks are written **with the diff and
   reviewed with it** in the same Codex pass, instead of shipping as a
   separate near-zero-stakes artifact with its own lifecycle.

   **Content and shape are governed by
   [`test-run-contract.md`](../../../docs/tests/test-run-contract.md)** —
   the section template, the read-only rule, "Replit owns the database
   connection," what earns a check and what to demote. I follow it rather
   than restating it. The short version, because I kept getting this
   wrong: **it verifies what only Replit's environment can verify** —
   live-DB migration state, post-merge repo-health gates, behavior against
   live config/data. Never a re-run of suites CI already ran. "none
   needed" is the correct content for a PR with nothing
   environment-specific.

   **Execution is part of close-out, not a separate ceremony.** After
   merge + sync, I drive the section through the Replit connector (the
   two-call sequence in `CLAUDE.md`'s connector policy, read-only scoping
   stated in the prompt), read the results back with `ask_question`, and
   report them — pass or fail — in the close-out merge report. A failure
   routes through the normal channel and the workstream stays at its
   verification stage until clean. A clearly-labeled mutating deploy step
   in the section (the contract's third permitted write shape) is mine to
   execute through the connector at the same point.

   **Legacy TEST_RUN files still in `docs/tests/Replit/` run out under the
   old pattern**: I drive each run, and on a full pass delete the doc (a
   tiny deletion PR, self-merged); its continued presence means not-run or
   not-clean. I do NOT create new TEST_RUN files, flag the absence of one,
   or "restore" a deleted one.

2. **`docs/tests/UAT/PR<N>_<FEATURE>_UAT.md`** — the in-app, click-through
   acceptance test for David, written to
   [`uat-doc-format.md`](../../../docs/tests/uat-doc-format.md). **That
   format is mandatory and it is not a style preference**: `/uat` drives the
   run by enumerating `### ` headings inside `## Steps` and `## Regression`,
   so a doc outside the format is a doc that cannot be driven. Setup lines,
   step shape (`Do:` / `Expect:`), regression IDs and the deliberate
   omissions all live there rather than being restated here. **This half
   stays file-based, but ownership of deletion changed (David, 2026-08-22):
   I delete a UAT doc once he confirms the run complete**, in the same
   close-out, rather than waiting on his own click — so the directory
   never accumulates finished tests. See `/uat` for the one exception
   (content worth harvesting first).

   Because the PR number is in the filename, the UAT doc follows the
   **PR-first** flow: open the PR with a "Docs pending" placeholder note,
   read the assigned number, write and commit the UAT doc to the **same PR
   before merge**, then replace the note with the link. `<N>` is the GitHub
   PR number; `<FEATURE>` is a SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE slug. The doc always
   lands on the same PR — never a separate later PR.

   **The doc is a script I drive, not a page he reads (David, 2026-08-21).**
   David works through it with me step by step via [`/uat`](../uat/SKILL.md),
   so write it for that: **setup is mine to execute** — the `[claude]` lines
   in the format — and `[david]` is reserved for what only his own session or
   device can do, admin-gated setup included (I hold no admin session; see
   `/uat` section 2). The doc is still the canonical script;
   **I delete it once he confirms the run complete** (David, 2026-08-22).

   **Every step gets a lane, and the default is a machine** (David,
   2026-10-07; the lanes are defined in
   [`uat-doc-format.md`](../../../docs/tests/uat-doc-format.md#lanes-where-each-step-is-verified-david-2026-10-07)).
   A step is `human` only when no machine can answer it — taste, legibility,
   whether a result reads right, or something only his own account or device
   can do. Everything else is `ci`, `scripted` or `live`, and **the check it
   cites is written in this same PR**, so the UAT he runs is the human residue
   and nothing more. **A behaviour a later PR delivers has no step here** — it
   belongs in the oracle's scope line (below). A behaviour **this** PR claims
   whose machine check cannot exist yet, because the double or fixture it
   needs lands later, keeps its machine step `**Deferred:** #N` to that
   owner, and **the owed check is recorded on issue #N when the line is
   written** (one comment naming the doc, the step and the check), so whoever
   lands #N knows it. **The PR that lands #N pays that debt in the same PR**:
   it writes the check and, in every UAT doc still on `main` that defers to
   #N, replaces the `**Deferred:**` line with the runnable `**Check:**` —
   the checker validates the citation, and a resumed `/uat` runs it. A doc
   already deleted needs nothing more than the record on #N.
   The deferred step is **never** turned into a `human` step to get past
   the wait: David's share is judgement only. Such a run is Blocked until #N
   lands, which is the honest state of a behaviour nothing has yet checked.
   `node scripts/check-uat-format.mjs` refuses a step without a lane and a
   machine-lane step whose cited check does not exist.

   **No Artifact page (David, 2026-08-21 — retiring the 2026-07-22 rule).**
   The Artifact existed as a reading surface for working through the doc
   alone on an iPad; the `/uat` session replaced that job. Publish one only
   if he asks for a solo run.

A product-visible PR is **not** complete — and I don't present it to David
as done — until the verification section has real content (or an explicit
"none needed") and the UAT doc exists and is linked, unless the
ship-the-UI-surface exception applies or the PR is in prototype phase (above). For the UAT's structure, follow
[`uat-doc-format.md`](../../../docs/tests/uat-doc-format.md) — **not** the
nearest surviving doc, which is how six competing conventions accumulated in
the first place. (Pure infra/refactor with zero
observable behavior can use a single short verification note in the PR body
instead, per the ship-the-UI-surface exception.)

**A phase PR gets its own UAT, and an added scope line.** When this PR is
one phase of a phased feature (see
[`workstream-tracking.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/workstream-tracking.md)'s
*Phased features*), two things change:

- **UAT is per-phase, not deferred to the last phase.** If *this phase* is
  product-visible, it ships its own `docs/tests/UAT/PR<N>_…_UAT.md` — the
  same rule as any other PR. Deferring every phase's UAT to the end would
  leave David with nothing to verify for weeks and would pile the whole
  feature's risk into one session. A phase with no product-visible surface
  of its own ships a verification note instead, same exception as always.
- **The oracle section gets a scope line** naming which of the parent
  plan's sections this phase *delivers* and which it *defers* to a later
  phase. Without it a reviewer can't tell an out-of-scope-for-this-phase
  gap from a silently dropped requirement — and the whole point of the
  oracle is catching a PR that quietly narrowed the approved scope. Cite
  the parent issue for the plan itself; the body's `Oracle source:` line
  (`claude-core.md` Pull requests rule 4) names the approved plan and its
  digest, and the scope line stays beside it in prose.

**Workstream label.** Per
[`workstream-tracking.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/workstream-tracking.md),
this skill owns no `stage:`/`waiting:` transition of its own — `pr-watch`
already owns `stage:code-review` for the PR this pairing rides on. Just
confirm the workstream issue's `mode:` label is `feature` (this pairing is
feature-mode-only), and once the UAT doc is committed, add it to the
workstream issue's State of Play `Artifacts` field — the UAT link is
exactly the kind of thing a cold-resumed session needs and won't find by
re-deriving it from the PR alone.
