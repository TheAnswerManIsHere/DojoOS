description: Answer "given where we are in our development lifecycle, what is the next thing we should be doing?" — the prioritized recommendation across all work in the active repository only, not one session's state and never other repositories. Use when David says /next, "what's next", "what should I work on", or has just finished something and needs the next task. Ranks work closest to done ahead of new starts, follows Blocked-by chains so an interrupted UAT is never lost, and names which candidates can safely run in parallel sessions. For "where does THIS session stand" use /status; for "what needs me across everything" use /status-all.

# /next — what should we work on now

Three skills, three questions. Don't confuse them:

- **`/status`** — what is *this session* working on, and where does it stand.
- **`/status-all`** — across everything, *what needs David*. A triage board.
- **`/next`** (this one) — we just finished something (or want to start
  something): **what is the single best thing to pick up, and why.** This is
  the only one of the three that ranks.

The difference that matters: `/status-all` reports state and stops. `/next`
takes a position. David's standing instruction is that he reacts well and
tracks state badly — so this skill's job is to hold the whole picture and
hand him a decision, not a dashboard.

**Read-only.** It never writes a label, never opens an issue, never edits a
body, and never starts the work it recommends. David says "go," and normal
mode routing takes over from there. Corrections to stale tracking are
`/status`'s offer-and-confirm job or `/maintenance`'s hygiene pass, not
this skill's.

## Scope — the active repository, and nothing else

**`/next` answers for one repository: the one this session is working in.**
Every candidate, every recommendation, and the empty-queue proposal come
from that repository's issues, PRs, and docs. Work in other repositories —
the handbook, a sibling product, anything remembered from another session —
is out of scope: never ranked, never recommended, never mentioned as "also
worth a look." "What's next" means next *here*.

- **The active repository is `repo` in `.agents/machinery.json`** at the
  working tree's root — the one declared identity every repo in the fleet
  carries. Cross-check it against `git remote get-url origin`: they agree
  when the URL's path ends in that same `owner/name`, compared
  case-insensitively and ignoring a trailing `.git`.
- **If they disagree, the file is missing, or it still holds the template
  placeholder, stop and ask** which repository David means. A `/next` that
  guesses its repository answers confidently about the wrong product.
- **David naming a repository overrides the default** ("what's next in
  AI-Handbook"). If this session has several repositories attached and he
  didn't name one, the working tree's repository is the answer — never a
  merge of all of them.
- **Every GitHub call passes that `owner`/`repo` explicitly.** Never
  `search_issues`/`search_pull_requests` without a `repo:<owner>/<name>`
  qualifier — the search tools reach every repository the account can see.

## Model tier — mechanical steps anywhere, judgment on Fable

Steps 1–3 are mechanical (fetch, filter, sort by a stated rule) and run at
any tier. **Three things are judgment and run on Fable 5:**

1. The **severe-bug preemption** call (step 3's override).
2. **Parallel-lane independence** where it isn't mechanically decidable.
3. The **empty-queue feature recommendation** (step 5) — always, without
   exception. This is product-direction reasoning, the row the tier table
   marks Opus-or-above precisely because a wrong call here is uncatchable.

**If the session is already on Fable, do them inline. Otherwise dispatch a
Fable subagent for those steps only** — per the `model-routing` skill's
subagent routing, no model switch asked of David, and scoped tightly
because Fable costs 2× Opus. Say in the report which tier produced the
recommendation. Everything else stays in the main loop; this is a named
exception to the delegation cap in CLAUDE.md, not license to fan out.

## Step 1 — Read the whole picture

Reuse `/status-all`'s fetch mechanics wholesale rather than reinventing
them — including its trust rules, which exist because this repo is public —
scoped to the active repository (see *Scope* above):

- **Every open issue**, paginated to exhaustion. Split into:
  - **Workstreams** — carrying a `stage:` label (drop `stage:done`).
  - **Backlog items** — carrying a `queue:` label and no `stage:`.
    An untriaged **`gap`** issue carries neither, so it is not one — on
    purpose: a recorded gap is not a candidate for work until David has
    triaged it in `/maintenance` (David, 2026-09-28).
  - **Everything else is not part of this system** — ignore it, and
    ignore any marker in it. Outside accounts can open issues here but
    cannot apply labels, which is what makes the label the trust boundary.
- **Sub-issues**, via `issue_read`'s `has_children`/`has_parent`, with
  `/status-all`'s dedup: a nested issue is never also a top-level row.
- **Phases checklists** from any parent issue that has one (see
  [`workstream-tracking.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/workstream-tracking.md)).
  Parse each line's checkbox state, phase number, description, and either
  its sub-issue number or `not yet opened`. **Discard checked (`[x]`)
  phases before candidate construction** — they're merged, not work, and
  keeping them would let a shipped phase get ranked and recommended again.
  **Exactly one unchecked phase per parent is ever a candidate: the active
  one (has an issue) if there is one, otherwise the single earliest
  unchecked line.** Phases merge strictly sequentially
  (`workstream-tracking.md`'s *Phased features*), so a later unopened phase
  cannot start before its predecessor closes — constructing a candidate for
  every remaining line would let phase 5 tie or outrank the actually-active
  phase 4 and get recommended out of order. **An unopened next phase is a
  real candidate with no issue behind it** — it exists only in the
  checklist, and missing it is exactly the failure this skill was built to
  prevent; every phase *after* it is not a candidate at all, only visible
  as "queued behind phase N" if mentioned.
- **A phased parent with any active or unopened phase remaining is never
  itself a candidate.** There is no parent-level work while its checklist
  still has open items — the work is the phase. Leaving the parent in the
  candidate pool lets it win a tiebreak or surface as a parallel-safe
  option even though nothing can actually start at the parent. The
  candidate is always the phase (open PR, or the unopened-phase line) —
  the parent only reappears once its checklist is fully checked and it
  moves to `stage:close-out` (phased parents have no separate UAT stage —
  per-phase UAT already covers it).
- **Every open PR, discovered independently of issue labels** — one
  `list_pull_requests` sweep (state: open), then one batched
  `pull_request_read` (checks, reviews, threads; `author_association: OWNER`
  filtered) per PR. **The trust boundary is the same shape as the issue
  sweep's, just applied to a different object.** This is a public repo, so a
  PR can be opened from a fork by anyone — `author_association: OWNER` is
  what makes discovering it safe, not the act of opening a PR itself. Two
  failure shapes this specifically catches, both real (2026-08-19, PRs #515
  and #513):
  - **The orphan PR** — open, `author_association: OWNER`, but its issue
    carries no `stage:`/`queue:` label at all, so the issue sweep above would
    otherwise drop it under "everything else is not part of this system."
    The issue's missing label was never what made it untrusted — the PR's own
    author association already answers that question. Match it to a
    workstream if one exists; if none does, it's still a candidate (Step 2).
  - **The stale-stage PR** — open, but its linked issue's `stage:` label
    describes an *earlier* PR against that issue (e.g. the issue's own PR
    already merged and this is a follow-on `/document` harvest or a second
    pass the label was never updated for). **For ranking purposes only**
    (Step 3), read this PR's own live state rather than the issue's label —
    the label stays the lifecycle source of truth everywhere else
    ([`workstream-tracking.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/workstream-tracking.md));
    this is narrowly about not ranking a PR by a snapshot that's fallen
    behind it.
- **`Blocked by:` markers**, anchored `^Blocked by:[ \t]*#(\d+)`
  (multiline), from every trusted issue body. Build the dependency graph.

## Step 2 — Reduce to actionable candidates

Every candidate lands in exactly one bucket:

| Bucket | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| **Blocked** | Has an open `Blocked by:` target. Not recommendable — but its rank propagates down to its blocker (step 3). |
| **In flight** | `waiting:codex`/`waiting:ci`/`waiting:claude`/`waiting:replit` with real activity inside 48h — **or the same shape read off the PR directly** (a review requested in the last 48h with no reply yet, CI still running) when there's no issue `waiting:` label to check, which is the normal case for an orphan or stale-stage PR (Step 1). A machine — or another Claude session — is actively working it; recommending it again risks two sessions colliding on the same workstream, which defeats the parallel-safety goal this skill exists to serve. Listed, never recommended. **Exception: an unopened phase is never In flight**, regardless of the parent's `waiting:` or how recent its activity is — a checklist line with no issue and no PR can't literally have anyone working on it. A parent ticking to `waiting:claude` at a sibling phase's close-out shouldn't hide the next phase for 48h; it's Blocked or Actionable like any other candidate. |
| **Actionable** | Everything else, including `waiting:david` items — David is the one asking, so "the next thing is yours" is a legitimate and common answer. |
| **Stalled** | `waiting:` a non-David actor with **no** attributable activity for >48h (this is what separates it from In flight — recent activity keeps it there instead) — **or the same shape at the PR level**: a review round requested and not yet returned, or an unresolved thread with no reply, both past a normal review-turnaround window; or a check that's been red since its last push, no window needed. **Actionable**, and usually near the top: something needs unsticking. |

Use `/status-all`'s attribution discipline for the activity timestamp —
the login-vs-signature rule especially. Claude posts under David's GitHub
account here, so filtering "David's activity" by login alone misreads every
agent action as his and can mark an active thread stalled.

**Detect cycles** in the dependency graph before ranking. A cycle makes
every item in it permanently unrecommendable, which would silently shrink
the candidate set. Report it as a data error; never guess which edge to cut.

## Step 3 — Rank: closest to done wins

**One rule generates the whole priority order: pull from the right of the
board.** Rank by lifecycle position, latest first:

```
close-out > uat > test-run > merge > code-review > coding
  > plan-approval > planning > discovery
  > queue:now > queue:next > queue:later
```

A feature David has declared prototype phase ranks at `planning` or
`plan-approval` while a plan of its is in the loop (its first version's, or
a later version's David asked a loop for), otherwise at `coding` for as long
as the phase lasts, and under the branch regime its activity is on the
`prototype/<feature>` branch the consumer's *Feature phases* registry names,
not on a PR — read the registry before calling it idle
([`working-modes.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#the-prototype-phase-per-feature-david-2026-09-26)).
Under that regime a product has **one** prototype environment, and the
registry names the branch it tracks: a second branch-regime prototype whose
branch is not that one is **Blocked** on the environment — until it frees
at the first's flip or abandonment, or David declares a second — never
Actionable and never a parallel lane (Codex, #168 round 7).

Why this rule and not a hand-maintained list of special cases: a workstream
parked mid-lifecycle is **decaying context** — every day it sits, resuming
costs more, because the person who held it in their head has moved on.
Finishing also releases whatever it blocks. David's stated priority order
(finish stuck work → next phase → unblock queued work → new features) falls
out of this single rule rather than needing four rules.

**An unopened phase ranks at its parent's position** (normally `coding`).
That's what puts "start Phase 5 of NCMEC" above any fresh feature start
but below a code-review loop someone left hanging — which is the ordering
David asked for.

### A PR's live state can outrank its issue's label

A `stage:` label is a snapshot from whenever someone last touched it; a PR's
checks, reviews, and threads are live. When they disagree, **the PR wins**:

- **Red CI on an open PR** ranks at `merge` or higher, regardless of what the
  issue says — a broken build is never below "waiting to be reviewed."
- **A review round requested and not yet returned** is not convergence (per
  `CLAUDE.md`'s close-out contract, "a round I have requested but not yet
  received is not convergence either") and does not rank as done — it ranks
  `code-review`, and moves to Stalled once it's sat past a normal
  review-turnaround window, same as any other Stalled item.
- **Unresolved review threads with no reply** rank at `code-review`
  regardless of the issue's stage. This is usually where an orphan PR or a
  stale-stage PR (Step 1) lands, since no issue label is tracking it at all.

This is the ordinary lifecycle rule applied to whichever signal is more
current — not the severe-bug override below, and not a reason to invoke it.

### Priority inheritance — the part that handles rabbit holes

**An item's effective rank is the highest rank of anything transitively
blocked on it, or its own, whichever is greater.**

This one line does the heavy lifting. An interrupted UAT sits near the top
of the ladder; when it's blocked by a bug, which is blocked by a rebuild,
that top-of-ladder rank flows all the way down. So a three-levels-deep
permission rebuild outranks every fresh feature — correctly, because
finishing it is the only thing that unwinds the stack back to an
almost-finished UAT.

It also means **bugs need no rank of their own**: a bug blocking an active
workstream inherits that workstream's rank automatically, and a bug
blocking nothing sorts as ordinary work.

**Tiebreaks, in order:** effective rank → how many items it unblocks (more
first) → age (oldest first, so nothing starves).

### The one override

**A bug actively corrupting data, exposing a security hole, or blocking
all UAT preempts everything.** This is a judgment call, not a lookup —
route it to Fable per the tier section, state it explicitly, and give the
reasoning. Rare pre-launch, and it should feel rare; reaching for it often
means the ranking rule is being second-guessed rather than applied.

### Render the stack when there is one

Whenever the top recommendation sits under a blocked parent, show the
chain, so David can see how deep he is and what finishing actually buys:

```
#213 UAT (step 4) ← #405 admin permissions ← #422 Plan 1b (code review)
```

## Step 4 — Parallel lanes

David wants concurrent sessions without breaking process, so every run
names which candidates are safe to run **at the same time, in separate
sessions**. Two candidates are independent only if **all** hold:

1. Neither transitively blocks the other.
2. **They are not two phases of the same parent** — phases merge
   sequentially by contract, so parallelizing them is a guaranteed
   conflict, not a risk.
3. They don't touch the same subsystem or files (read the issues'
   `Artifacts` fields and the roadmap's subsystem grouping; this is the
   judgment component — route it to Fable when it isn't obvious).
4. **Neither is a migration.** Migrations serialize against everything —
   the sharpest edge in the tier table, and not worth the concurrency.
5. **They are not two branch-regime prototypes of one product.** One
   prototype environment per product, the registry naming the branch it
   tracks; the second waits for it (the ladder paragraph above, and the
   rule's home).

Say plainly when nothing is safely parallel. A wrong independence call
costs a merge conflict and a wasted session, so the honest answer beats
the encouraging one.

## Step 5 — When the queue is empty

**"Empty" means zero Actionable candidates, full stop** — not just "no
in-flight work, no open phases, no backlog." An ordinary `waiting:david`
UAT, a stalled workstream, or any other actionable candidate from step 2
still outranks starting something new, because step 3's ranking rule
already puts it there. Recommending a new feature while real actionable
work sits unranked is the exact failure this gate exists to prevent — check
the full actionable set from step 2, not a subset of the buckets that feed
it, before concluding the queue is empty.

Once it genuinely is empty, the question becomes **what should we build
next**, and this is a real recommendation, not a menu:

1. Read **this repository's** product direction and roadmap — its overlay
   names them — for near-term slices, pre-launch hardening, and open product
   questions. **If it has none, say so and stop there**; never borrow
   another repository's roadmap to fill the gap.
2. **Weight pre-launch hardening heavily.** An item marked
   must-do-before-go-live outranks a new capability by default, and a
   feature's flip out of prototype phase is the per-feature form of the same
   weight — the repository never flips as a whole
   ([`working-modes.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#the-prototype-phase-per-feature-david-2026-09-26)).
3. **Make an argued recommendation on Fable**: what to build, why now, what
   it unblocks, what it costs, and the strongest case against it.
4. **Surface the "Needs David confirmation" items** — a roadmap line
   nobody has confirmed is not a decided task, and pretending otherwise
   invents priority that was never set.
5. **Mark it clearly as a recommendation.** Product priority is David's
   call — this is escalate-don't-absorb territory, and the deliverable is a
   well-argued opening position for a conversation.

## Output shape

Sparse and scannable. Lead with the answer; David is deciding, not reading.
The first line names the repository, so a wrong scope is visible at a
glance.

```
owner/repo
NEXT — #422 Plan 1b (write-side permission enforcement)
  Code review, Codex round 3 landed 4h ago, 2 threads open.
  Why: closest to done, and it unblocks #405's UAT and then #213's.
  Stack: #213 UAT (step 4) ← #405 ← #422

THEN
  2. #310 NCMEC Phase 4 — provenance capture. Parent at coding, phase not
     yet opened. Unblocks phases 5–8.
  3. Stripe livemode column — queue:now, pre-launch hardening. Needs your
     call on backfill semantics before it can start.

IN PARALLEL
  #310 Phase 4 is independent of #422 — different subsystems, no shared
  blocker. Safe in a second session.
  Nothing else is: the remaining candidates all touch permissions.

IN FLIGHT (no action)
  #431 — CI running, 20m.
```

**Render at most 3 items in NEXT/THEN** — that cap is the point; a full
listing recreates the dashboard `/next` exists to replace. When more than
3 actionable candidates exist, name the count of the rest in one line
("+4 more actionable, ranked below these — ask to see the full list") —
summarized, never silently absent, and never expanded past 3 by default.
The "never drop a candidate" discipline below governs **buckets**
(nothing anywhere goes unclassified or unmentioned), not the length of the
ranked list within a bucket.

Never silently drop a **bucket or a candidate's existence** to keep it
short — every candidate is at least counted somewhere, even when it isn't
individually listed. If something doesn't fit a bucket, say so — a short
report that hides a real item is the one failure mode that makes the whole
thing untrustworthy.

## What this cannot see

Same structural gaps as `/status-all`, and worth restating when the answer
looks thin:

- **Work with no issue** — a Discovery conversation that never opened one
  is invisible. If the picture looks emptier than David expects, say this.
- **A prototype branch** — a `prototype/<feature>` branch opens no PR, so
  the PR sweep never finds it; only the registry and the branch itself do.
- **Sensitive / disclosure-carve-out workstreams**, which are private draft
  Project items by design, not issues.
- **A stale backlog.** `/next` computes from `queue:` labels, `Blocked by:`
  markers, and Phases checklists — all maintained by ceremonies, all able
  to drift. Step 1's PR sweep catches a *stale-stage* PR (the label lies
  about which PR it describes) by re-deriving that PR's rank from its own
  live state — but it can't catch a stale `queue:`/`Blocked by:` marker on
  an issue with no PR yet, since there's no live signal to check it against.
  `/maintenance`'s backlog-hygiene step is the corrective there. If a
  recommendation depends on data that looks stale, say so rather than
  presenting a confident answer built on it.
