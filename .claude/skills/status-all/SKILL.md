name: status-all
description: Give David a cold-open summary of EVERY open workstream across all sessions in the active repository (never other repositories) — where each stands in the lifecycle, who's holding it, and which ones are stalled or need his input. Use when David says /status-all, "what's the state of everything", "what needs me across the board", or is picking work back up after time away and doesn't remember where he left off. This is the ALL-SESSIONS view of this repository; for "what is THIS session working on", use /status instead. Best run from a fresh, cheap session rather than an existing long thread.

# /status-all — the workstream board, read cold

**All-sessions view, one repository.** For one session's own state — "what am I working on right now
and how does it fit" — that's [`/status`](../status/SKILL.md), which is a
different job: cheaper, scoped to one workstream, and able to offer to fix
stale tracking. This skill answers "across everything, what needs me?" —
where "everything" is every session working in **this** repository, never
the other repositories in the fleet.

David runs ~10 concurrent sessions across Discovery → Planning →
🛑 Plan approval → Coding → Code review → 🛑 Merge → Test run →
🛑 UAT → Close-out — or, for a feature he has declared prototype phase,
Discovery → Planning → 🛑 Plan approval for its first version, then Coding →
🛑 his feedback → Coding, with no code review and no UAT
([`working-modes.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#the-prototype-phase-per-feature-david-2026-09-26)). He can't tell which sessions need him without opening
each one. This skill answers that from **outside** any of them, using
GitHub as the shared substrate — no session memory required, which is why
it works cold in a brand-new session and shouldn't be run inside a long
existing thread (that burns the wrong session's context for no benefit).

**This is a read-only reporting skill.** It never writes labels, comments,
or issue bodies — that's `pr-watch`, `plan-review-loop`, `bugfix`,
`prototype` and `pr-docs`'s job at the moments those already fire. (The old automated
exception, the `test-run-completion.yml` Action, is retired with the
TEST_RUN file pattern, 2026-08-15 — the `stage:test-run` →
`stage:uat`/`stage:close-out` transition is `pr-watch`'s close-out
sequence now.)

## Scope — the active repository, and nothing else

**`/status-all` reports on one repository: the one this session is working
in.** Every row comes from that repository's issues and PRs. Workstreams in
other repositories — the handbook, a sibling product, anything remembered
from another session — are out of scope: never listed, never counted, never
mentioned as "also needs you."

- **The active repository is `repo` in `.agents/machinery.json`** at the
  working tree's root — the one declared identity every repo in the fleet
  carries. Cross-check it against `git remote get-url origin`: they agree
  when the URL's path ends in that same `owner/name`, compared
  case-insensitively and ignoring a trailing `.git`.
- **If they disagree, the file is missing, or it still holds the template
  placeholder, stop and ask** which repository David means. A board that
  guesses its repository reports confidently on the wrong product.
- **David naming a repository overrides the default** ("status-all for
  AI-Handbook"). If this session has several repositories attached and he
  didn't name one, the working tree's repository is the answer — never a
  merge of all of them.
- **Every GitHub call passes that `owner`/`repo` explicitly.** Never
  `search_issues`/`search_pull_requests` without a `repo:<owner>/<name>`
  qualifier — the search tools reach every repository the account can see.

## Why this reads issues + labels, not the Project board

No tool available to me can read *or* write GitHub Projects v2 item field
values — confirmed by direct search when building the sync mechanism
(`scripts/sync-project-fields.mjs`, PR #318/#322). Labels are the actual
source of truth; the Project board is a projection of them for David's
visual scanning. So this skill recomputes the same view the board shows,
directly from labels — it doesn't (can't) query the board itself. If the
board and this report ever disagree, the board is stale and labels are
right (or the sync Action needs a look).

## What this cannot see

**Work with no issue yet.** A pure Discovery conversation that hasn't
produced an issue is invisible to GitHub entirely — this is a structural
gap, not a bug in this skill. If a `/status-all` run feels like
it's missing a session David knows is active, that session hasn't opened
its workstream issue yet. Mention this possibility in the report if the
count looks low relative to what David expects.

**Sensitive/disclosure-carve-out workstreams.** Per the plan-review-loop's
disclosure rule, those live as draft Project items, not issues, precisely
because this repo is public. They're deliberately invisible to any
tool-based report, including this one.

## Step 1 — Fetch every open workstream issue

Page through **all** open issues, not just the first page — a single
capped call silently drops any workstream past the page boundary, and a
missing row reads as "nothing needs attention," the opposite of what this
report promises:

```
list_issues(owner, repo, state: OPEN, perPage: 100,
            fields: [number, title, labels, updated_at])
# repeat with pagination until the response is exhausted
```

Filter out anything without a `stage:` label — that's not a workstream
issue (shouldn't happen if `/document`, `bugfix`, `prototype` and
plan-review-loop are tagging correctly, but don't assume).

For each issue, parse its labels the same way `sync-project-fields.mjs`
does:
- `stage:*` → lifecycle stage (exactly one; more than one is a real data
  error — flag it in the report rather than silently picking one)
- `waiting:*` → who's holding it (david / claude / codex / replit / ci)
- `mode:*` → feature / bugfix / docs / devops

## Step 2 — Fetch sub-issues, then deduplicate the top-level set

For every workstream issue, call `issue_read` (`method: get`) — this same
call already returns `has_children` **and** `has_parent`/`parent`, so check
both, not just the downward direction. Where `has_children` is true,
`get_sub_issues` to pull the children (e.g. a `/document` harvest nested
under its parent feature). **Filter the returned children to `state: OPEN`
before rendering** — `get_sub_issues` returns closed children too (e.g. a
harvest sub-issue that finished and closed while its parent stayed open
through UAT), and this is a report of *open* work, so a closed child
should render as neither a nested row nor inflate any count. An open
sub-issue is its own row with its own `stage:`/`waiting:` labels — render
it nested under its parent, not flattened into the top-level list.

**An open issue can have a parent that's already closed** — a
documentation-harvest sub-issue can outlive its feature (the parent closes
first, the harvest lags a little). Downward traversal alone misses this:
Step 1 only fetched *open* issues, so a closed parent was never in that
set for `get_sub_issues` to be called on. Use `has_parent`/`parent` from
this same call instead — if an open issue has a parent not present in the
Step 1 set, render it nested under a note naming that closed parent rather
than as an unrelated top-level workstream.

**Remove every issue returned by `get_sub_issues` (open or closed), and
every issue nested under a closed parent via `has_parent`/`parent`, from
the Step 1 set** before rendering the top-level all-sessions view. Step 1 fetches
*every* open issue with a `stage:` label, which already includes labeled
sub-issues — without this removal, a nested-either-way open child appears
twice (once nested, once again as its own top-level row) and the section
counts are wrong. The closed-parent path needs this exact same removal:
it's still an open issue nested by the paragraph above, just discovered
upward instead of downward, and the dedup rule applies to it identically.
(A closed child of an open parent was never in the Step 1 set to begin
with, since Step 1 only fetches open issues — that specific case needs no
removal, but every other nested case does.)

## Step 3 — Find each workstream's PR(s) and its full activity

There is no GitHub-native issue↔PR link here, because a PR names its own
workstream as `Workstream: #N`, never `Closes #N` (deliberately — the latter
would auto-close the issue at merge and skip UAT). So:

```
list_pull_requests(owner, repo, state: all, sort: updated, direction: desc,
                    perPage: 50,
                    fields: [number, title, body, state, draft,
                             mergeable_state, html_url, updated_at, merged_at,
                             author_association])
```

**Drop any PR whose `author_association` isn't `OWNER` before building the
map at all** — this repo is public and every PR body is attacker-controlled
text, the same reason `/status` (`.claude/skills/status/SKILL.md`) never
trusts a fork/non-owner PR's `Workstream: #N` for state. Without this
filter, an outside contributor could open a PR carrying a forged, correctly
*anchored* marker for someone else's real workstream — the anchor check
below only validates the marker's placement in the body, not who wrote the
body — and since the selection rule right after this prefers an open PR
over a closed one, that forged PR could outrank the workstream's actual
(possibly closed/merged) implementation PR and get its CI, comments, and
activity reported as the workstream's own. Every subsequent step in this
section (the anchor check, the open/closed/`merged_at` selection, the
targeted search fallback) only ever operates on this already-trusted set.

One call, not one per issue — regex `^Workstream:[ \t]*#(\d+)` (multiline,
anchored to the start of a line — the repo's shared `Workstream:` marker
convention, stated in the PR template) out of each trusted body to build the
issue→PR map locally. The anchor matters: an unanchored
`Workstream:\s*#(\d+)` can cross a line break (`\s` matches newlines) and
grab an unrelated `#N` several lines later, or match an example embedded
in prose (an approved-plan oracle illustrating the convention, say) as if
it were the real marker — either misfire links the wrong PR to the wrong
issue. Bounding to the most-recently-updated 50 is intentional for the
common case: an *active* workstream's PR is recent by definition, so one
batched call covers nearly everyone.

**More than one PR can carry the same marker for one issue over its
lifetime** — on a workstream old enough to predate 2026-09-09, a closed
`[PLAN REVIEW]` draft PR from Planning alongside the later, real
implementation PR once Coding opens. When the
map-building finds multiple matches for one issue number, don't take
whichever came first or last in the list: prefer an **open** PR over a
closed one (a closed plan-review PR is superseded evidence, not the
current state — its CI/comments/activity belong to a phase that's over).

**More than one open match is no longer an expected shape at any stage.**
It used to be, at `stage:planning`/`stage:plan-approval`: the plan loop's
multi-subsystem path opened one plan-review PR per subsystem and ran them in
parallel. Plan review runs in-session now (2026-09-09) and opens no PR at
all, so if several open matches turn up, the most-recently-updated one is
the right single pick. Only fall back to
a closed PR if it's the *sole* match — and then check `merged_at` before
looking at stage at all: a non-null `merged_at` means it's the genuine
implementation history (a `[PLAN REVIEW]` PR is never merged, per
`plan-review-loop`'s own contract), so a sole *merged* match is trustworthy
regardless of what stage the issue is at now — accept it, including at
`stage:test-run`/`stage:uat`/`stage:close-out`, where discarding it would
lose exactly the CI/comments/activity those later stages need most. A sole
match with a **null** `merged_at` (closed-unmerged) is honest evidence of
"no implementation PR yet" only while the issue is still at
`stage:planning` or `stage:plan-approval`; at `stage:coding` or later
that's the *obsolete* plan-review PR outliving its usefulness, not the
current state — treat the issue as having no linked PR instead (Step 4's
no-PR path, using its own comment history) rather than computing status
from a thread that belongs to a phase that's already over.

**`stage:planning` and `stage:plan-approval` have no PR by design
(2026-09-09), and that is health, not absence.** The plan loop runs
in-session against a plan that is never pushed, so a workstream in either
stage has nothing to find and no targeted lookup is warranted. Report it
from the issue's own labels and comment history — Step 4's no-PR path —
and never as missing, unlinked or stalled on the strength of having no PR.
Reading a healthy planning workstream as stalled is the specific
misclassification this paragraph exists to prevent (Codex, #69 round 1).

**A prototype-phase feature under the branch regime has no PR by design
either**, at `stage:coding` from its first version's approval for as long as
the phase lasts (back at `stage:planning` only while a loop David asked for
runs): the consumer's
*Feature phases* registry names its `prototype/<feature>` branch, and that
branch, not a PR, is where its activity is. Check the registry before the
targeted PR lookup below, read activity from the branch's commits, and
report it from the issue's labels — never as unlinked or stalled for having
no PR ([`working-modes.md`](../../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#the-prototype-phase-per-feature-david-2026-09-26)).

**Once the implementation PR itself merges, both matches are closed** — the
plan-review PR (never merged, per `plan-review-loop`'s own contract) and
the now-merged implementation PR. Both show `state: closed` alone, so tell
them apart by `merged_at` (non-null only for the real implementation PR) —
this is exactly why the batched call above requests it. A closed
`[PLAN REVIEW]` PR is definitionally unmerged, so among multiple closed
matches prefer the one with a non-null `merged_at`; it's the real
implementation history (UAT status, CI, comments) an issue at Merge/Test
run/UAT/Close-out needs, not the plan-review artifact. Most recently
merged/updated among ties, same as the
open case.

**But recency isn't proof of "no PR" for a workstream at a long-lived
gate.** An issue sitting at `stage:merge`/`stage:uat`/`stage:close-out`
for a while is exactly the kind of thing that stops generating new PR
activity — its own PR isn't updating, so 50 *other*, busier PRs (routine
bugfixes, devops, docs) can push it off the page even though it's still
genuinely linked. Don't treat every issue the top-50 scan didn't match as
stalled: for any workstream at a stage that structurally implies a PR
should already exist — **`coding` onward** — with no match in the map, do
one targeted lookup instead of assuming — search for `"Workstream: #<N>"` in PR bodies
(`search_pull_requests`, query `"Workstream: #<N>" in:body
repo:<owner>/<repo>`) before concluding it's actually unlinked. **Run every
hit through the same two checks as the batched scan above — `author_association
=== "OWNER"`, then the anchored `^Workstream:[ \t]*#(\d+)` regex — before
trusting it.** Search results are exactly as attacker-controlled as the
batched list, so skipping the trust filter here would reopen the same
forged-marker risk through the fallback path. GitHub's text search also
matches the phrase anywhere in the body, including inside an approved-plan
oracle's illustrative example or prose mentioning the convention, not just
on the canonical marker line. A hit that fails either check is exactly the
false-link risk both checks exist to prevent, so it's not the workstream's
PR — treat the workstream as still unlinked, the same as no hit at all. This only fires
for the rare case the batched scan missed, so it stays cheap in the common
case while closing the gap for long-lived gates.

For any workstream issue with a linked PR, pull live state in one batched
call: `pull_request_read` (`get_status` for CI, `get_review_comments` for
open threads, `get_comments` for top-level issue comments, `get_commits`
for attributable push history, **and `get_reviews` for formal review
submissions**) — same discipline as `pr-watch`, minimal calls, no
per-thread narration in the output.
**Page `get_commits`, `get_review_comments`, `get_comments`, and
`get_reviews` to exhaustion**, the same way Step 1 pages through issues —
a review loop that's gone several rounds can exceed one page of any of
these,
and a single capped call can silently return an incomplete prefix that's
missing the most recent commit, reply, or review. Since Step 4 picks the
*latest* item across these collections, an incomplete page doesn't just
under-report — it can make an active workstream look stalled. `get_comments`
matters here, not just for completeness: this repo's Codex loop delivers
some events — a clean re-review pass, an `@codex review` trigger — as
plain issue comments rather than inline review threads. Skipping
`get_comments` makes those events invisible, which can
misreport who's actually holding a workstream. `get_reviews` matters for
the other direction: a clean Codex pass delivered as a normal
`pull_request_review` with **no** inline findings shows up in neither
`get_review_comments` (empty — no threads) nor necessarily as a top-level
issue comment (`docs/ai-context/working-modes.md`'s own account of this
shape) — it's only visible as a review object, with its own actor and
submission timestamp. Skipping `get_reviews` means this specific "Codex
returned a clean pass, nothing left to fix" event is invisible to this report,
which can leave a `waiting:codex` workstream looking falsely stalled or
its activity timestamp falsely stale. `get_commits` matters for Step 4's
stall detection: a PR's raw `updated_at` advances on *any* update —
including a relabel or a David edit with no comment — but carries no
actor, so it can't tell you who moved it last. Commit authorship can.

## Step 4 — The judgment layer (this is the actual point)

GitHub's board can show a static Status/Waiting-on value. It cannot tell
David *why* something is stuck or *what exactly* he's being asked. That's
what turns this from "a slower way to read the board" into something
worth running.

### Stalled detection

**A David-gate is `waiting:david`** — and since 2026-08-15, that alone.
`waiting:replit` used to count as one (David ran the TEST_RUN checklist
and relayed the result); the post-merge verification run is now driven by
the agent through the Replit connector inside close-out, so a workstream
sitting at `waiting:replit` is agent-held work — it buckets and
stall-detects like `waiting:claude`, and a lingering one means a close-out
some session needs to finish, which is exactly what the stalled bucket
exists to surface. `/status`'s five-state table
(`.claude/skills/status/SKILL.md`) made the matching move.

A workstream is **stalled** when `waiting` is NOT a David-gate (per the
definition above — a David-gate is "needs you," a more urgent bucket, never
double-counted as stalled) and there has been no relevant activity — no new
commit, no Codex comment, no reply from Claude — for **more than 48 hours**.

**A GitHub login match is not proof David personally acted — I post
through David's own GitHub account in this environment, not a separate
bot identity.** Every reply, review comment, and commit I make in this
repo appears under `TheAnswerManIsHere`'s login (confirmed by this very
PR's own reply-thread history). Filtering "authored by David"
by login alone therefore misclassifies every one of my own responses as
David's — discarding real activity and reporting an active, answered
thread as stalled, the opposite of what this filter exists to catch. Tell
them apart by **content, not login**: a comment or review I post carries
the Claude Code attribution footer (`_Generated by [Claude Code]`), and a
commit I make carries a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer (this repo's own
convention for both) — either signature means it's my action, genuine
non-David activity, even though the author field reads David. Only an
item with David's login **and no such signature** is David's own act.
This applies everywhere "exclude David" appears below.

**Compute the activity timestamp from the latest *attributable, non-David*
action** (per the distinction above) — the newest of: the latest commit's
author + date (`get_commits`), the latest review comment's author +
timestamp (`get_review_comments`), the latest issue comment's author +
timestamp (`get_comments`), and **the latest formal review's actor +
submission timestamp (`get_reviews`)**, all from step 3. A clean Codex
pass with no inline findings only shows up in this last collection —
omitting it is exactly the gap that makes a workstream whose head is
genuinely reviewed, `waiting:codex`, look stalled or under-timestamped.
**Never use the PR's raw
`updated_at` as an activity signal on its own** — it advances on any
update (a relabel, a David edit with no comment) but carries no author, so
it can't be attributed to "David" or "not David" at all; treat it only as
a fallback when none of the three attributable sources above yield
anything (e.g. a brand-new PR with no commits fetched yet). A
`waiting:claude`/`waiting:codex` thread that David pinged after it had
already gone quiet is exactly the stale handoff this report exists to
catch; using David's ping — or the `updated_at` bump it causes — as the
activity timestamp resets the 48-hour clock and hides it. If David *was*
the last person to act (e.g. he already answered and nobody has picked it
up since), still report that fact plainly — just don't let his own
activity mask a stale non-David handoff underneath it.

**A workstream with no linked PR can stall too** — this isn't limited to
Discovery/Planning: any workstream Step 3 confirms has no linked PR
(including a genuinely PR-less Coding-stage issue, e.g. before its
implementation PR has opened) sitting at `waiting:claude`/`waiting:codex`
with no repo activity for days is stalled the same way a quiet PR thread
is — except that for a branch-regime prototype (above) the activity is the
`prototype/<feature>` branch's commits, read before the issue's comments.
For these, apply the **same attributable, non-David filtering as the
PR path above** (the login-vs-signature distinction included) to the
issue's own comment history (`issue_read`, **paged to exhaustion, same as
the PR path's `get_commits`/`get_review_comments`/`get_comments`**), not
its raw `updated_at` alone. A single capped page can omit the latest
non-David reply the same way an unpaged PR call can, and mis-mark an
active issue stalled or attribute the last move to the wrong actor. A
David comment, label edit, or body edit advances `updated_at` the same
actorless way a PR's does, and would reset this clock and hide the same
stale handoff the PR path is designed to expose — don't let "no PR yet"
mean "can't be stalled," since a workstream that never gets a PR shape
stalls in exactly the same way, just on a different object. **If the
*filtered, attributable* comment set is empty** — either because the
paged history has nothing at all (an issue freshly opened with nothing
posted since), or because every comment in it is David's own (per the
signature-based filter above, with nothing left once his items are
excluded) — fall back to the issue's own `created_at` as the baseline
activity event. Both cases leave this algorithm with no non-David
timestamp to measure the 48-hour threshold against, and treating only
the empty-history case as the trigger would let a `waiting:claude`/
`waiting:codex` issue containing nothing but David's own unanswered
prompts evade the stalled bucket indefinitely — the same failure mode
the signature-filter fix above exists to close, just one step later in
the pipeline.

This catches both directions: `waiting:codex` with no Codex response
(review hasn't landed) *and* `waiting:claude`/`waiting:codex` with a
comment sitting unanswered (a dropped thread — this is exactly how #281
sat six days: Codex posted round 2, nobody replied, session ended). Don't
distinguish "whose fault" in the report — state the fact (last activity,
how long ago, who was last to act) and let David or the resuming session
draw the conclusion.

48 hours is a default, not a hard rule — if David asks for a tighter or
looser window in the invocation (e.g. "/status-all stalled=24h"),
honor it.

### Plain-language blockers for anything on a David-gate

Don't just say "needs you" — say **what**, restated in one sentence from
the actual source, not guessed from the stage name alone. Applies to the
David-gate value (`waiting:david` — since 2026-08-15 the only one; see the
David-gate definition above):

- If there's an open, unresolved review thread addressed to David → read
  it and restate the actual question in plain language.
- If the gate is structural (🛑 Scope of work, 🛑 Plan approval, 🛑 UAT, or —
  on a prototype-phase feature at `stage:coding` — a usable version delivered
  and waiting on his feedback through the rail) with no open question — say
  so plainly, and **match the example to the gate actually held**, since none
  of the four is a merge gate any more:
  "scope agreed in outline, waiting on your go-ahead before the plan is
  drafted" / "plan v3 delivered in chat, waiting on your approval" /
  "merged — UAT doc at `docs/tests/UAT/PR<N>_..._UAT.md`, not
  yet run". Search for the UAT doc filename before claiming one doesn't
  exist.
- **Never assert a reviewer's state from a gate.** The middle example above
  once read "plan v3 delivered in chat, **nothing outstanding with Astra**,
  waiting on your approval", and that sentence is false in a state the planning
  loop explicitly supports: `settled-over-dissent`, where a technical tie was
  settled over an objection Astra still holds and the approval ask is required
  to name it. Nothing this session can read would catch it — the concern ledger
  lives in `.agents/reviews/`, which is gitignored, so it never reaches GitHub.
  Report a concern only when an available source establishes it; an approval
  gate establishes neither unanimity nor a blocker. (Codex, #124 round 8
  `4045616307`.)
- Accuracy over cheapness here: a wrong restatement makes the whole report
  untrustworthy, which defeats the purpose. Read the actual comment/thread
  rather than inferring from labels alone.

`waiting:replit` is **not** in this section's scope — it's agent-held
close-out work and renders in the stalled/in-progress buckets, never under
🛑 NEEDS YOU. When reporting one, say what's pending and where, e.g.
"merged, post-merge verification checks from PR #<N>'s body not yet driven
through the connector — a session needs to finish close-out."

## Step 5 — Render the report

Sparse, scannable, grouped by urgency — David is triaging across ten
things, not reading a document. Rough shape (adapt to what's actually
found; don't pad empty sections). The first line names the repository, so
a wrong scope is visible at a glance:

```
owner/repo
🛑 NEEDS YOU (n)
#311 — CodeQL rate-limiter: merged, UAT doc ready at docs/tests/UAT/PR308_..._UAT.md, not yet run
#281 — Evidence retention plan: [specific restated question from the thread]

⚠️ STALLED (n) — no activity >48h, nobody currently blocked on David
#309 — Evidence retention: Codex posted round 2 findings 6d ago, unanswered
#313 — CodeQL false-positive record: same pattern, 2 unanswered findings

IN PROGRESS (n)
#310 — NCMEC reporting: code review, waiting on Codex (last activity 3h ago)
#312 — Ledger [LEDGER] PRs: code review, waiting on Codex

CAN'T SEE
Reminder that Discovery-stage conversations with no issue yet won't appear here.
```

A section header is a plain label, not the chat-interruption
`🛑 **NEED YOU**` banner ritual (rule/bold/rule) — this is a status
report, not a mid-task blocking question, so don't dress it up as one.
The 🛑 glyph itself is fine to reuse since it's already how the lifecycle
stages and the board's own columns are named; just don't imitate the
banner's structure here.

No item anywhere gets silently dropped to keep the report short — if
something doesn't fit a bucket cleanly, say so rather than omitting it.

## Drill-down: `/status-all <issue-number>`

Skip the all-sessions view. Fetch that one issue's full body (its State of Play
block), its linked PR's live CI + all open threads, and its sub-issues if
any. Report in full — this is the "come back to one session cold" case,
so completeness matters more than brevity here.

## Model tier

Ops-shaped, checkable output, no product surface → **Sonnet**, per
CLAUDE.md's tier table. If invoked on a higher tier, no need to flag it —
this isn't the kind of task where a mismatch matters.
