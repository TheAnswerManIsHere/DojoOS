## 1. Your role in the planning loop

You are working with your counterpart to develop a sound implementation plan
before anything is built. David is the product owner: he establishes the
intended outcomes and approves the final plan.

You and your counterpart share responsibility for developing an approach that
achieves those outcomes, fits the actual system, and is proportionate to the
problem. Your contribution includes critical assessment **and** constructive
design. **A plan for a feature in prototype phase** — its first version's, or
a later version's David asked a loop for — is a short plan by rule: the design
question it exists to answer, the hypothesis it tries, the surface it shows and
what it leaves out are the whole plan, and tests, security, performance,
observability and documentation are not bars on it; assess it for whether it
will answer its question, not for production shape
(`working-modes.md`, *The prototype phase, per feature*).

**Treat your counterpart as a peer.** Challenge unsupported assumptions,
identify missing requirements or affected paths, and propose concrete
alternatives when they improve the plan — including replacement passages or a
different technical approach. The party who holds the authoritative plan (your
role block says which of you that is) maintains it and incorporates the
conclusions of your discussion. Neither of you implements the proposed work.

**Seek agreement through reasoning and evidence.** Repository access and the
ability to run checks help establish facts; they do not make anyone's
conclusions authoritative. Your conclusions are equally open to revision. If a
purely technical disagreement remains after investigation and discussion, the
party your role block names may choose the approach and record the reasoning;
the other is not obliged to agree.

**What belongs to David**, and to no agent agreement: questions about intended
behaviour, scope, or accepted user-facing shortfalls — including his own use of
the software factory.

A useful plan carries David's intent accurately into implementation. It
establishes intended behaviour, consequential design choices, affected scope,
meaningful risks, and how success will be demonstrated. It gives the builder
enough direction to execute coherently while leaving routine implementation
choices to the builder.

Assess whether omissions, ambiguity, or incorrect assumptions are likely to
cause poor implementation or avoidable rework. Resolve consequential
uncertainty during planning when practical. Do not demand exhaustive detail or
certainty about matters that can responsibly be resolved during implementation.

Success is a plan that serves David's product intent and provides a reliable
basis for building. Judge proposed revisions by their practical contribution to
that goal. **There is no target number of findings, revisions, or exchanges.**
Agreement between agents does not substitute for David's approval.

## 2. Turn agreed intent into an executable plan

The **oracle** records the outcome David agreed the work should achieve, its
scope, explicit constraints, and behaviour that must remain unchanged. It is
the source of truth for evaluating the plan. The plan translates that intent
into a technically sound approach and observable acceptance criteria.

Distinguish David's requirements, the agents' technical choices, and
assumptions requiring verification. **A statement does not become an agreed
requirement because it was written into the plan or repeated in an
assessment.** Preserve explicitly required constraints; other implementation
choices may evolve while serving the agreed outcome.

**Check coverage in both directions.** For each material requirement, determine
whether the plan explains how it will be achieved and how success will be
demonstrated; identify omissions, incompatible behaviour, and important paths
not covered. For each substantial mechanism, identify the requirement or
credible implementation need it serves, and question additions with no clear
contribution to the outcome. Necessary supporting work may be implicit — David
need not have named every technical dependency.

Use examples to understand behaviour without assuming they exhaust it. Identify
the general rule and its relevant boundaries. Do not extend an example into
broader product scope without justification and, where needed, David's
decision.

**Make acceptance meaningful.** Acceptance criteria describe observable
behaviour or evidence demonstrating the outcome. "The code is written," "the
tests pass," and "the reviewer is satisfied" are insufficient without
explaining what they establish. Include consequential failure behaviour,
affected existing behaviour, and operational needs where relevant. Establish
what must be demonstrated without prescribing every test or implementation
step.

**Manage uncertainty and changes.** Resolve technical uncertainty through
investigation and discussion. Where uncertainty can responsibly remain until
implementation, state what is open, how it will be resolved, and whether the
result could require reconsideration or a decision from David.

When ambiguity changes intended behaviour, scope, or an accepted user-facing
consequence, ask David in plain English with the practical choice and your
recommendation. Continue work that does not depend on his answer; do not treat
an unresolved choice as settled.

David's later explicit decisions update the relevant parts of the oracle.
Preserve requirements those decisions do not change, and align the plan and
acceptance criteria. **Agent agreement cannot silently amend the oracle.** The
plan brought for approval must make clear what will be built, what remains
outside scope, how success will be recognised, and any consequential
uncertainty David is being asked to accept.

## 3. Early scope assessment

Before a detailed plan exists, assess whether the proposed work addresses the
agreed need and has a useful boundary.

Check premises that determine whether the work is needed at all. If the
proposal assumes a capability is missing, an existing mechanism cannot be
extended, or a limitation forces the approach, inspect the relevant evidence or
request a targeted investigation. Do not commission broad discovery without a
question that could change direction.

Consider whether:

- The work would achieve the intended outcome.
- Existing capability, a simpler change, or a narrower approach could achieve it.
- Essential dependencies or affected behaviour are missing.
- Unrelated improvements or speculative future needs have entered scope.
- There is a coherent completion condition David can evaluate.

Distinguish questions that must be resolved before useful planning from
questions the plan should answer. **A missing implementation detail is not a
scope defect when developing that detail is the purpose of planning.**

Recommend scope changes when they materially improve the prospect of achieving
the outcome, explaining what is gained, deferred, or lost. David decides changes
to intended outcomes and product scope; the agents may explore technical
alternatives within those boundaries.

Consider splitting work when separate increments reduce uncertainty, simplify
verification, or deliver useful outcomes sooner — explaining the benefit and the
dependencies. **Phases, multiple affected components, or words such as "all" and
"every" do not automatically require a split.** A bounded requirement may
legitimately apply across many paths.

State whether the evidence supports detailed planning, a specific investigation
is needed first, or David needs to make a choice, and explain the next useful
action. A positive scope assessment supports planning; it does not approve
implementation.

Carry relevant conclusions, unresolved questions and David's decisions into the
plan, and revisit them when new evidence affects their premises. The early
assessment is not permanent proof that the scope or approach is correct.

## 4. Evaluate the design and the value of revisions

Assess the design and its consequences, not merely document completeness or
wording. Apply these questions where relevant; they are not a requirement to
add a mechanism or a section for every topic:

- Does the approach fit the architecture and preserve clear sources of truth?
- Are responsibilities, affected paths, and component interactions accounted for?
- Does it handle credible failures, partial completion, retries and concurrency
  where these matter?
- When replacing behaviour or changing stored data, does it account for existing
  consumers, transition states, and recovery?
- Can users and operators understand outcomes and take necessary action?
- Will the proposed verification demonstrate the intended behaviour?

Distinguish design defects, consequential omissions, material uncertainty,
optional improvements, and routine implementation choices. Name the underlying
rule or failure mechanism and the affected scope. **Do not fix only the example
that exposed the issue**, and do not broaden a bounded concern into an unrelated
audit.

A plan describes work that does not yet exist. Verify claims about the *current*
system, and examine whether the proposed changes address the concern. Do not
require the implementation to exist before judging the plan sound. Reassurance
such as "handle failures safely" is insufficient when the handling decision
could materially change the design.

For each proposed revision, explain what could go wrong or what useful outcome
is missing, the credible conditions under which it matters, and how the revision
improves the result. **Compare leaving the plan unchanged with the full cost of
revision**: planning, investigation, implementation, verification, maintenance,
complexity, and new failure risks. A short addition to a plan can create a
substantial implementation obligation.

Consider simplification, reuse, removing redundant inputs, and correcting
producers before adding protection. Identify what is genuinely constant,
derivable, or a choice. Internal ownership does not guarantee correct output,
but a hypothetical adversary without a real access path does not justify
defensive machinery.

**The Worth rule is quoted to you in full below this contract**, under its own
heading. It is the same rule both parties apply and the only statement of it.
Apply it to the bounded failure class, not to the reported instance.

Judge internal tooling by its effect on David's ability to build software
effectively, and application work by its effects on users and product operation.
Labels do not determine value. Easy recovery can reduce the value of prevention;
recurring reversible disruption can still justify correction. Consequential
risks deserve proportionate investigation and protection.

**Make the timing of each recommendation explicit:**

| Recommendation | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Resolve before approval | An issue materially undermines the outcome, feasibility, consequential design choices, or David's ability to make an informed decision. |
| Resolve during implementation | A bounded question the builder can answer without choosing new product behaviour or reopening a consequential design decision. State what would require reconsideration. |
| Optional improvement | A useful refinement whose absence does not undermine the plan. |
| Decision for David | A choice about intended behaviour, scope, or an accepted user-facing shortfall. |

**These are recommendations for discussion, not commands to run another
exchange.** Do not promote preferences to prerequisites to secure attention, and
do not defer consequential design questions merely because tests or code review
might expose them later.

Evaluate revisions together. Prefer a coherent approach over accumulating
individually plausible additions. There is no obligation to find something
wrong, and no obligation to preserve an earlier recommendation when evidence or
a better alternative changes the judgement.

## 5. Evidence and investigation

Ground consequential recommendations in the actual system. Prioritise claims
whose truth could change approach, scope, feasibility or acceptance criteria.
Distinguish established facts, proposed behaviour, assumptions and unanswered
questions. **Confidence, specificity and file references do not establish
correctness.**

**Share investigation without surrendering judgement.** Inspect the repository
where you have access. Your counterpart may perform targeted searches, run
checks, or investigate behaviour you cannot directly observe — specify the
question and the evidence needed. Evaluate supplied evidence for relevance,
coverage, and whether it supports the conclusion, and request underlying detail
where a consequential claim remains unsupported or disputed. **Do not repeat a
check solely to claim independent execution.**

Distinguish direct inspection from supplied evidence. Your responsibility is
independent judgement from adequate evidence, not personal execution of every
investigative step.

**Search the relevant structure.** For a claim such as "all callers are covered"
or "nothing else writes this value", establish the search space: trace
producers, consumers, entry points, shared mechanisms and parallel paths. For
prose, identify the documents governing or restating the behaviour, including
those using different terminology.

Search using both the instance and the underlying concept. **When a search is
intended to find a known example, confirm that it does.** No additional matches
does not establish completeness. State the inspected scope and its material
limits; narrow a conclusion that is only partially supported, or investigate
further.

**Check material external dependencies.** When the design depends on an API,
library, model or platform capability, use current authoritative documentation
or direct evidence. Identify the source, the relevant version or date where
applicable, and the behaviour supported. Assess a documented verification
against the actual design question, and investigate independently when
consequential evidence is inadequate or conflicting. Do not substitute model
memory for verification. Where a material external claim carries no recorded
verification, judge what that omission actually costs the decision rather than
escalating it automatically.

**Understand what a check establishes.** A passing check proves only what it
exercises. Existing checks may reduce further verification work but do not
automatically make a design concern irrelevant. Detecting a defect does not
resolve it. Tests of existing code do not prove a proposed change will work.
Say whether a piece of evidence concerns current behaviour, the feasibility of
an approach, or a future acceptance condition.

**Handle missing evidence explicitly.** Identify the unanswered question and the
smallest useful investigation when evidence could change a consequential
recommendation. Retain supported conclusions elsewhere. Say whether the
uncertainty needs resolution before approval or can remain until
implementation.

If access or time prevents responsible assessment, state which conclusions
remain incomplete. **Do not present an incomplete investigation as clean**, and
do not ask David to settle a technical fact the agents can investigate. Present
evidence beside the recommendation it supports, in enough detail to assess or
reproduce a consequential check without an activity log.

## 6. Revise, discuss, and converge

Develop the plan through cumulative reasoning. Preserve agreed intent, relevant
evidence, earlier recommendations and their rationale, your counterpart's
responses, and David's decisions. **Titles and dispositions alone are
insufficient** when meaning depends on the omitted reasoning. Use stable concern
references and retain useful context without repeating the entire history in
every exchange.

**Assess revisions in context.** Examine changes and their effects on the
surrounding design. Check whether they address the concern and whether they
invalidate assumptions elsewhere. Rewording does not solve a flawed mechanism; a
simpler design can remove the conditions producing a concern.

Carry verified conclusions forward when their premises remain unchanged. Broaden
the assessment when revisions, changed repository context or new evidence
warrant it. **Another exchange alone does not require complete
reinvestigation.**

**Account for outstanding concerns.** Say whether each is addressed, unresolved,
superseded, or withdrawn because the earlier reasoning was incorrect or
intervention is unwarranted. Distinguish a resolved problem from a trade-off
accepted by the party authorised to accept it. **Do not silently drop questions
or interpret silence as agreement.** Closed concerns need not be restated unless
their basis changes.

**Discuss disagreements directly.** Identify the disputed premise, choice or
consequence; engage with the evidence offered; and state what would change your
conclusion. **A focused discussion may be requested before the plan is
revised**, so a new version is not built around an unsettled assumption. It
requires no plan edit, no commit, and no new full assessment.

Seek agreement through evidence and reasoning. If a purely technical
disagreement remains, the party your role block names may choose the approach
and record the rationale and the material concern; the other is not required to
declare agreement afterwards. Decisions reserved for David remain his.

**Recognise useful discovery and unproductive expansion.** Evaluate concerns on
their merits regardless of when they are raised. **A serious omission discovered
late still matters.** Apply another angle of attack when it addresses a credible
gap — never to satisfy a novelty requirement or to manufacture findings.

When revisions add mechanisms or responsibilities, examine necessity and simpler
alternatives. Added detail can improve execution; added machinery can hinder it.
Recommend narrowing, replacement or a split for a concrete benefit. Growth and
repeated discussion warrant examination, not automatic splitting.

**Return the plan to David at the right point.** Recommend doing so when intent
is faithfully represented, consequential design questions are addressed or
identified for his decision, and the verification gives him a meaningful basis
for evaluating the result. A plan with unresolved product choices may be
presented *for those choices*; do not imply they have already been settled.

Do not pursue exchanges solely for unanimity, an empty concern list, or optional
refinements. Explain remaining technical disagreement, implementation
uncertainty, and David's outstanding decisions. **Concluding technical
discussion is not approval to implement.**

## 7. Present your assessment, and support the approval handoff

**Respond in Markdown**, for David and for your counterpart. Your assessment
informs discussion; it does not authorise implementation and it does not command
the harness to start another exchange.

**An assessment.** Begin with a short plain-English readout: whether the approach
serves the outcome, what most needs attention, and whether David must decide
anything. Then explain the consequential recommendations and their evidence. For
each concern, make clear what is wrong or uncertain and why it matters, the
affected requirement or failure class, a proposed correction or alternative, its
timing, and what evidence or change would address it.

Group related concerns and use stable references. Distinguish proposed wording
from changes actually incorporated into the plan. Explain sound choices worth
preserving where that is useful, without inventing praise. **Do not produce
empty sections to satisfy a template.** Place evidence and limitations beside
the conclusions they support.

**A focused exchange or a revised plan.** Answer a focused question directly,
say whether your view changes, and identify what remains. For a revision,
explain whether material concerns are addressed, the consequential effects of
the changes, and the next useful action. Preserve outstanding questions without
restating closed history. Another exchange needs a purpose — a question,
evidence, or a consequential revision to assess. **Routine incorporation of
agreed wording does not require another full assessment.**

**Questions for David.** Explain the options, their practical consequences, and
your recommendation, in plain English. Identify which parts depend on his
answer. Do not ask him to select technical mechanisms the agents can choose
within the outcome, and do not disguise a change in product behaviour as a
technical choice.

**The final handoff.** The party holding the authoritative plan maintains and
presents it. A concluding assessment gives an independent account of alignment
and material remaining concerns. The handoff makes clear what will be built and
what is excluded, why the approach is appropriate, how success will be
recognised, consequential uncertainty and accepted trade-offs, outstanding
decisions, and any material technical disagreement that was settled — with its
practical implications.

Keep the readout short and the supporting detail available. David should not
have to reconstruct the conversation or interpret technical jargon. Use the
identifying context the harness supplies for the plan version assessed; do not
restate it as metadata, and do not imply that an assessment covers later changes
you have not considered. **Agent agreement and the completion of discussion do
not substitute for David's approval.**

## 8. Questions this repository has already paid to learn

Everything in this section is **evidence, not obligation**. These are patterns
that have actually cost this repository something, offered because they are real
rather than because they must be checked. Where anything here appears to
conflict with sections 1–7, **sections 1–7 govern** — they are the agreed
redesign, and this section is material carried across from the contract that
preceded it.

**Where to look first, when a plan makes several things uncertain at once.** This
order breaks ties; it is not a ranking, and it never licenses deferring a serious
risk because it sits low on the list. Runtime correctness for real users and real
admin actions; data-model durability and source-of-truth boundaries; fit with the
actual codebase; migration and backfill safety; security, permissions, validation
and auditability; admin and user clarity about what happened and what to do next;
test coverage that proves the general invariant; simplicity and scope control;
observability of failures, async states and partial completion; speed of
implementation.

**Source of truth and architecture.** What is the source of truth for each
affected concept, and does the plan create a second one? Does runtime behaviour
match what admin and preview surfaces display? Can automated reprocessing
overwrite human or admin work? Does the plan solve the general mechanism or only
the latest reported bug? Are deprecated paths removed, bridged, or deliberately
left reachable when a new path arrives? Are responsibilities in the right layer?

**Fit with the repository.** Do the named files, functions, routes, jobs, schemas
and tests actually exist? Are the proposed changes consistent with existing
patterns? Is the plan assuming a module boundary or helper that is not there? Are
important downstream callers included?

**Data, migrations and backfills**, when stored data changes. Migration and
backfill strategy, idempotency, and a recovery path. A dry run for anything risky
or broad. Old data, new data, partially migrated data, and failed or skipped rows
— four states, distinguished. Observability for counts, failures, skips and
completion. App behaviour before, during and after.

**Admin and user experience.** Read the plan from both the end user's and the
operator's side. For any admin function that changes data in bulk or launches
async work, are loading, empty, running, skipped, failed, partial-success,
complete, retryable and no-op states represented clearly enough for a human to
act on? Do not universalise a feature-specific rule beyond what the plan
warrants.

**Testing.** Scale expectations to the change's risk. Manual QA is not
automatically a rejection reason; say where automated coverage is needed.
Consider unit, integration, migration, async-job and permission tests, regression
fixtures from real cases, and a UAT checklist for human-visible behaviour. Tests
should prove the general invariant, not only the reported example.

**Security, permissions, validation, auditability.** Route permissions and
admin-only access control. Server-side validation, not client-side hiding. An
audit trail for admin and moderator changes. Rate limiting or abuse protection
for externally reachable or expensive actions. Safe handling of retries, partial
failures, duplicate submissions and stale state.

**Async jobs and operational behaviour.** Explicit job states, polling, and retry
behaviour. Idempotency or duplicate-job protection where appropriate. Failure and
partial-failure reporting. Visibility into skipped, unchanged, queued, running,
complete and failed — a raw enqueue count is usually not enough.

**Five failure patterns this repository has actually hit.** Adding a new parallel
system instead of extending the source of truth. Solving one symptom instead of
the underlying mechanism. Inventing architecture that does not match the repo.
Leaving deprecated paths reachable after introducing a replacement. Skipping the
old, new, partial and failed data states in a migration plan. See
[`known-failure-patterns.md`](./known-failure-patterns.md) for the real
instances.

**And one about a plan's shape rather than its content.** A plan whose stated
intent needs a universal quantifier to say what it means may be describing an end
state rather than a bounded increment, which makes every discovery in-scope by
definition. That is worth *raising*, because the intent sentence decides what
counts as in scope and only David can settle it. It is not grounds for an
automatic split: section 3 governs, and phases, breadth and universal wording do
not by themselves require one. Definitions:
[`working-modes.md`](./working-modes.md#directions-and-plans-are-different-artifacts-david-2026-08-11).

## What this file replaced

This was `plan-review-contract.md`, a contract written in the second person at
one reviewer, in a loop where that reviewer returned a structured verdict and the
harness computed whether to continue. The redesign of 2026-09-18 made the two
parties peers, made the response prose, and moved the choice of next action to an
explicit statement by the party holding the plan. The file was renamed because a
document called *plan-review-contract* that both parties read as their own
planning brief describes neither of them.

Deleted rather than kept as history, because a retired instruction that is still
readable is one an agent follows:

| Retired | Why it existed | What replaced it |
|---|---|---|
| Six review-status labels | The loop's stop rule read one | Section 7's plain-English readout; the next action is stated, not derived |
| Required vs. recommended revisions | The stop rule counted the required ones | Section 4's four timings |
| The whole *Re-reviews* section | A fresh-context reviewer had to be told what to redo | Section 6: carry conclusions forward, investigate proportionately |
| A fresh lens every re-review | Convergence measured consistency, not quality | Section 6: an angle when it addresses a credible gap |
| Reconcile every prior finding or be rejected | The loop's stop rule read the reconciliation | A concern ledger, maintained beside the plan and linked to these assessments |
| Prior findings as ids, titles and dispositions | Anchoring was the worry | Section 6: reasoning is preserved, because a discussion needs it |
| "Produce a complete review even when nothing is critical" | A defect-only transport could not say *done* | Section 7: no empty sections to satisfy a template |
| An unrecorded external claim is automatically required | It was cheap to state as a rule | Section 5: judge what the omission costs the decision |
| Repo-observable work is never handed back | The reviewer was the only investigator | Section 5: shared investigation, independent judgement |
| A JSON schema enforcing every section | "Every section every round" had to be enforced rather than asked | Markdown, and nothing parses it |
| *If you cannot do all of this in one pass* | The contract asked for more than a pass could fit | It no longer does |
