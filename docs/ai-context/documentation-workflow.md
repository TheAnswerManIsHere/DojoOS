When a feature is done, the durable learnings from building it — decisions
and their *why*, gotchas, the new shape of a subsystem — should be locked
into the repo's versioned docs before the chat that holds them evaporates.
This is that ceremony. It turns the standing "memory lives in files" habit
into an explicit fold-in pass, and where a repo keeps a human-facing Manual
(`docs/manual/`) it is how that Manual gets written, incrementally, one area
at a time. A repo without one skips the Manual step; the harvest into
`docs/ai-context/` and `.agents/memory/` is the part that always runs.

**When it runs (David, 2026-08-20 — superseding the per-merge trigger):**
**batched at `/maintenance`**, one pass covering every product feature merged
since the last maintenance run — a feature still in prototype phase is not
harvested until the hardening PR that follows its flip has closed out, since
what it records is by design not yet how the system works, and the flip is
persisted before planning starts while the implementation still changes
through the standard loop; the close-out, which posts the harvest-notes
comment, is the eligibility point, never the registry flip (Codex, #168
round 7; [`working-modes.md`](working-modes.md#the-prototype-phase-per-feature-david-2026-09-26)). David can also invoke it directly whenever he
wants. It no longer fires per merge, and there is no run/don't-run judgement:
the per-merge ceremony was producing roughly a quarter of all merged PRs,
several of them harvests of harvests.

**Process PRs get no harvest.** Guards, scripts, skills, agent contracts and
process documentation are excluded by class — anything durable they produce is
a Type 1 learning (below), already persisted.

**The bridge that makes batching safe: a harvest-notes comment at every
close-out.** Before the batched pass exists to read them, each production-phase
product feature's close-out posts a short comment on its workstream issue —
decisions and why, alternatives rejected, gotcha candidates. Cheap, always, no
PR — and a prototype-phase PR posts none, since nothing about how the system
works is decided yet (the phase rule above, and its home in `working-modes.md`
*The prototype phase, per feature*). Without it a
weekly pass would be reconstructing intent from cold diffs, which is exactly
what this ceremony exists to avoid.

**Two kinds of documentation, two schedules (David, 2026-08-20).** Keeping them
apart is what lets the heavyweight half be batched safely:

- **Type 1 — how we work together: immediate.** A new rule, a process gotcha, a
  retired mistake — anything that changes how the agents operate — is persisted
  the moment it is learned, into `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `working-modes.md` or
  `.agents/memory/`. This is the "remember this" mechanism (mechanism 1 below)
  and it never waits for a batch.
- **Type 2 — how the system works: batched.** Subsystem docs and Manual
  chapters, harvested in the `/maintenance` pass described here.

## Relationship to the other two memory mechanisms

The repo has **three** related-but-distinct memory behaviors. Keeping them
separate is the whole point — don't collapse them:

1. **Targeted persistence ("remember this").** David says "remember this"
   about **one specific item** — a preference, a rule, a fact, a gotcha — and
   the agent persists *that item* immediately to its right durable file. This
   is unchanged and is **not** this ceremony. (For Claude: CLAUDE.md's
   "When David says 'remember this'" rule.)
2. **Area working notes ("memory lives in files").** While building, the agent
   proactively keeps a running working-notes doc for the area, capturing
   decisions and subsystem shape *as work progresses*. This ceremony **relies
   on** those notes as a harvest source but does not replace them.
3. **The `/document` ceremony (this doc).** At a feature's *end*, a harvest
   runs across the agent-facing docs and — when warranted — the human
   manual, triggered either by David or by the agent's own close-out
   judgement (see above). This is the heavyweight, whole-feature pass.

### Trigger semantics — decide by what "this" refers to

The decisive factor is the **referent**, not just the phrase:

| David's phrasing | Referent | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/document`, "document this feature", "lock in the learnings from this feature", "write up what we learned", "commit this feature's learnings to memory" | a **feature, PR, slice, build, or set of learnings** | **Full ceremony** (this doc) |
| "remember this: …", "commit this to memory" | **one** specific preference, rule, fact, or gotcha | **Targeted persistence** (mechanism 1 — persist that item now) |
| "document this" / "commit this to memory" with **no clear referent** | unclear | Ask **one numbered question**: targeted persistence, or the full ceremony? |

Worked classifier examples (a fresh agent should sort these without guessing):

- "Remember this: don't use `-B` for bugfix branches." → **targeted
  persistence** (one rule).
- "Commit this feature's learnings to memory." → **full ceremony** (a build's
  worth of learnings).
- "Document this." (bare, no referent) → **ask one numbered question.**

## Step 1 — Harvest

**In the batched `/maintenance` pass (the normal case), first enumerate the
window**: every production-phase feature merged since the last maintenance
pass (the phase rule above), and
for each one its **harvest-notes comment on the workstream issue** — the
close-out bridge that carries the build session's context. The batch covers
ALL of them; skipping a feature whose notes exist is a miss, not a judgment
call (Codex, #543). Then, per feature, richest source first:

1. **The harvest-notes comment** — decisions and why, alternatives rejected,
   gotcha candidates, written while the build session still held them.
2. **The build session itself, when this runs inside one** (a direct ad-hoc
   invocation by David) — decisions and the *why* behind them, dead ends and
   why we rejected them, behavior discovered, scope deliberately cut.
3. **The feature's diff** — `git diff origin/main...HEAD` on the feature
   branch (or the merged PR's diff if the branch is gone). What changed in the
   system's actual shape, data flow, or source-of-truth boundaries?
4. **The area's working-notes doc**, if one was kept during the build.
5. **The plan doc + PR/bot-review discussion** — including a bot-review finding
   that revealed a real, generalizing pattern.

The ask-David-which-feature question is reserved for a **direct ad-hoc
invocation** in a fresh chat with no build context and no maintenance window
to enumerate — never for the batched pass, which derives its coverage from
the merged-PR list rather than a choice.

**The bar for a durable learning:** *would a fresh agent or a new human
collaborator need this to work in the area?* Qualifying kinds:

- A settled decision + rationale (especially "tried X, rejected it because Y").
- A change to a subsystem's shape, data flow, or source-of-truth boundary.
- A gotcha that cost real time and generalizes beyond the one instance.
- A new term of art.
- A retired mistake that must not be reintroduced.
- Roadmap movement: a slice shipped, a new open question.

**Do NOT document:** transient run details, speculation about undecided future
work, per-PR checklists (that's what the PR's verification section and UAT docs are for), restatements
of already-documented truth (link instead), or anything invented rather than
observed — an unverifiable product claim is marked **Needs David confirmation**,
same as the roadmap does.

**Proportionality.** Output scales to what was actually learned. If a feature
produced nothing durable, the run says so and stops — it does not manufacture
doc churn to look busy.

## Step 2 — Route each learning to its one canonical home

Single source of truth: each learning lands in exactly **one** place; every
other mention links to it.

| Learning | Canonical home |
| --- | --- |
| Subsystem truth changed (architecture, pipeline, data flow) | The matching `docs/ai-context/<subsystem>.md` (`visual-pipeline.md`, `taxonomy-and-enrichment.md`, `token-rendering-and-grammar.md`, `moderation-workflow.md`, `architecture-map.md`, …) |
| Settled decision + why | [`decisions.md`](./decisions.md) — append-only, newest first, its **date · title — Decision / Why / Reference / Revisit if** format |
| Product-level failure pattern / retired mistake | [`known-failure-patterns.md`](./known-failure-patterns.md) |
| Engineering/repo gotcha (build, tests, codegen, env) | A note in `.agents/memory/` **plus** its one-line entry in `.agents/memory/MEMORY.md` |
| New term of art | the repo's glossary |
| Shipped slice / new open question | the repo's roadmap (move shipped work to "recently merged"; trim per its header) |
| Engineering practice changed (testing, migrations, review) | The matching `docs/engineering/` doc |
| A brand-new context doc was created | Add it to [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) routing |
| How the area works + why, for humans | The area's chapter in the repo's Manual, where it keeps one (Step 3) |

Worked routing examples:

| Example learning | Where it goes |
| --- | --- |
| "The Visual Concept is now the authoritative scene." | `decisions.md` (the decision + why) **+** `visual-pipeline.md` (the spec); the manual chapter links both |
| "Never hand-edit a generated reference." | Link to the generated document itself; no restatement anywhere |
| "A command failed because the test DB was missing." | `.agents/memory/` **only if it recurs / generalizes**; a one-off run detail is not durable |
| "We coined a new term of art." | the repo's glossary |
| "We want a manual-chapter backfill, but later." | the repo's roadmap, deferred work |

**Edit the existing docs in place** — extend and correct them so they describe
*current* truth. Do **not** append "learnings from PR #N" journal sections; the
chronology lives in `decisions.md` and git history.

## Step 3 — Update the manual chapter (only when it clears the quality bar)

The manual is human-facing narrative — what an area does, how it behaves, and
**why it's built that way** — governed by the Manual's own README, where the repo keeps one
(audience, tone, chapter template, TOC). Follow that charter.

**Quality bar — no empty chapters.** Create a chapter *only* when there is
enough durable product/process/subsystem truth to write useful present-tense
narrative across the template's sections. A small, localized learning updates
the relevant ai-context / decision / roadmap / memory doc (or an existing
chapter) — it does **not** spawn a skeletal chapter with headings and no
substance. When a real chapter is added, add it to the README's TOC in the
same commit. **Link, don't fork:** deep spec stays in `docs/ai-context/` and
generated references stay generated;
the chapter links to them.

## Step 4 — Cross-check before committing

- Every learning has exactly **one** canonical home; other mentions are links.
- The manual and `docs/ai-context/` do not contradict each other — if the
  feature changed truth, *both* sides of any overlap got updated.
- `AGENTS.md` routing and the manual TOC point to any new files.
- No invented product truth: unverified claims carry **Needs David
  confirmation**.
- **Generated docs were not hand-edited.** If generated content
  (e.g. `ADMIN_FIELD_REFERENCE.md`) is wrong, fix the generator / source
  registry and regenerate — never the output file.
- **Per-claim verification, not just cross-file consistency** (added
  2026-08-19 after PRs #525/#513/#528 each shipped a claim of this shape,
  documented in
  [`known-failure-patterns.md`](./known-failure-patterns.md#a-document-harvest-drafted-immediately-after-its-triggering-pr-ships-claims-it-hasnt-actually-verified)).
  This repo's cross-check step already covers **product**-truth claims — no
  invented product truth, unverified product claims carry *Needs David
  confirmation* — and none of the seven instances behind this addition were
  product claims, so that part of the check isn't in question. What it
  didn't ask about is narrower and specific: claims about this repo's own
  tooling, process, and sourcing. For every such claim in the harvest that
  isn't a plain restatement of the diff, ask which of these it's making, and
  verify it on those terms:
  - **A fact** — is it actually true, not just plausible? (#525 asserted a
    security mechanism that doesn't exist in this repo.)
  - **A scope** — does it claim only what was demonstrated, not a
    broader-sounding version? (#528 generalized "this mutation is still
    caught" into "this test is correct and reliable.")
  - **An internal consistency** — does it agree with the neighboring text in
    the same entry, not just with other files? (#513 stated an unconditional
    rule two lines above a carve-out that contradicted it.)
  - **A citation** — does it represent the *full* source, not a convenient
    half of it? (#513 credited one of two conditions a cited source named.)
  - **A number** — was it actually counted, never invented for rhetorical
    weight? (#513 asserted a specific threshold with no measurement behind
    it.)
  - **A routing decision** — does it point at the doc that actually owns
    that *kind* of tracking (e.g. `deferred-work.md` for deferred
    engineering work), not wherever was convenient to write? (#513 left a
    CI-guard candidate in review prose instead of the backlog.)

## Step 5 — Report & commit

**Report timing** — proportional, so the ceremony neither invents friction nor
commits ambiguous truth:

- If routing is **unambiguous and every claim is repo/session-grounded**, write
  the docs and report the *completed* routing (file → one-line gist) in the
  final summary. No mandatory pause for mechanical doc routing.
- If any claim needs **product judgment** — an unverifiable product claim, a
  "was that a decision or a deferral?" call — stop before committing *that*
  claim and ask David, as **numbered** questions.
- If David explicitly asks to **review the proposed routing before commits**,
  report the plan first and wait.

**Commit** as one docs-only commit (or a few, if ai-context vs. manual
separation aids review). Placement:

- **The batched `/maintenance` pass (the normal case): one docs-only PR per
  maintenance pass, not one per feature** (David, 2026-08-20 — this is what
  ends the harvest-PR churn the batching exists to remove). The pass's harvest
  commit rides the maintenance docs PR alongside that week's
  `deferred-work.md` updates; it is internal **by consequence and
  recoverability** — a docs pass touching no approvals, publication,
  credentials or destructive machinery — so it is the **Documentation review
  class**
  ([`working-modes.md`](working-modes.md#two-classes-outside-the-review-loop-trivial-and-documentation-david-2026-09-25)):
  one Astra and Fable pass over the change, with Codex's automatic pass as one
  input, one
  coherent batch of corrections if any are warranted, then merge, with the
  merge report saying what the batch changed. (Until 2026-09-25 this was the
  two-review limit's loop: the Codex pass, a batch, a review of the corrected
  head.) **No
  per-feature harvest sub-issues**: the tracking is the harvest-notes comments
  already sitting on each feature's workstream issue, plus the maintenance
  report naming what was harvested. (The per-harvest sub-issue machinery below
  applies only to the standalone ad-hoc path.)
- **Ad-hoc standalone invocation: assume the feature's PR is already merged.** David's stated
  workflow is that he only invokes `/document` once the work being documented
  has merged, so this is the default path, not a state you need to check for
  first: `git fetch origin main`, restart the branch fresh off `origin/main`
  (same branch name is fine — GitHub auto-deletes the merged one), and open a
  **new**, small docs-only PR. Docs PRs have no product-visible behavior, so
  **no UAT doc and "none needed" post-merge verification** — a short
  verification note in the PR body suffices. If a stale remote ref of the old feature branch exists (a
  same-name push can recreate one GitHub already auto-deleted), confirm the
  owning PR is actually merged/closed before deleting that stale ref, and
  never force-push. **Restarting the branch removes staleness, not
  collisions**: if another PR merged in the interval and touched the same
  shared docs files, reapplying your edits can produce a real merge conflict
  — resolve by keeping both sides' entries, never by picking one (see
  `.agents/memory/document-ceremony-concurrent-docs-pr-conflict.md`).
- **Only if you have clear session evidence the feature's PR is still
  open** (e.g. you're running `/document` mid-build, before the PR merged) →
  commit to that same branch instead, so the learnings ship and get reviewed
  with the feature. Don't go hunting for an open PR "just in case" — the
  default above is the common case.

## The harvest itself is a tracked workstream

**Scope: this applies only to the standalone ad-hoc path above** (a new,
dedicated docs-only PR for one feature's harvest). **The batched
`/maintenance` path is exempt** (David, 2026-08-20): its tracking is the
harvest-notes comments on each feature's own workstream issue plus the
maintenance report, and its delivery PR is the maintenance docs PR — no
per-feature sub-issue, no separate subscription ceremony. The mid-build exception — committing to the feature's own
still-open branch/PR — has no separate harvest PR at all; the feature's own
workstream issue already covers it, and nothing below applies.

Per [`workstream-tracking.md`](./workstream-tracking.md), a standalone
harvest has its own branch, PR, and review loop, so it gets its own board
row — a **sub-issue** of the feature's workstream issue, never folded into
the parent as a status value. This applies to every agent running this
ceremony, not just Claude's enactment of it:

1. Open the harvest PR **as a draft, and do not subscribe or apply any
   label yet.** Draft status only defers Codex's *auto*-review — it does
   **not** defer the watching agent's own subscription (Claude subscribes
   to every PR it creates in the standard loop, draft or not — a
   prototype-phase PR and the phase's registry PRs are the exceptions, per
   the phase rule cited above) or any labeling that
   subscription's own review-loop skill would otherwise do on PR-open.
   Treat steps 2–3 as blocking: no subscribe, no `Workstream:`-line read,
   no label write, until the sub-issue (or standalone issue) is real and
   the line is corrected.
2. **Disclosure check first**, same as the feature-level check the parent
   went through: if the harvest itself is sensitive — most directly, if the
   feature it documents was itself routed through the disclosure carve-out
   and therefore has no public parent issue *for that reason* — it does
   **not** get a public issue of any kind, sub- or standalone. Use a
   private draft Project item instead. Don't assume every parentless
   feature is simply pre-tracking legacy work; check why the parent is
   missing before defaulting to the public path.
3. For everything else: open the sub-issue, parented to the feature's
   workstream issue if one exists (`stage:code-review`, `waiting:claude` while
   the draft is Claude's to finish; from step 5, `pr-watch`'s labels apply —
   `mode:docs`, its own State of Play block). **If the feature never got
   its own workstream issue** for a genuinely legacy reason (a `/document`
   run against pre-this-system work, not a disclosure carve-out) — open the
   harvest as a **standalone** `mode:docs` workstream issue instead of
   skipping tracking. `pr-watch` needs *some* issue to label regardless of
   whether a parent exists, and an untracked harvest is invisible to
   `/status-all` and the board despite having its own real review loop.
4. Set the PR body's `Workstream:` line to the sub-issue (or standalone
   issue) just created — never the parent, which is typically already well
   past this harvest's own stage.
5. **Now subscribe, mark the PR ready, and run its review.** A harvest is
   the Documentation class — one Astra and Fable pass, Codex's automatic
   pass as one input — unless it
   is one of the changes that class does not cover, which stay in the
   standard loop; that list is
   [`working-modes.md`](./working-modes.md#two-classes-outside-the-review-loop-trivial-and-documentation-david-2026-09-25)'s
   alone, and is not restated here. Subscribing only now, not at step 1, is what actually defers
   labeling — draft status alone does not.
6. From there the harvest is watched exactly like any other PR — the
   normal review-loop skill/process for that agent owns the label
   transitions and State of Play upkeep from this point on.

## Boundaries

- This is **write-down-what-happened**, not a design session. An unresolved
  product question surfaced during harvest goes into the report (and possibly
  the roadmap's "Open product questions") — it is not silently settled into
  `decisions.md`.
- It does not replace the in-build habits (pause-and-ask during the build; the
  running working-notes doc). `/document` is the backstop and the fold-in.
- **Docs-only.** If harvesting reveals a *code* problem, that's a report item
  for David (bugfix mode or new feature work) — never a drive-by code change
  inside a `/document` run.
