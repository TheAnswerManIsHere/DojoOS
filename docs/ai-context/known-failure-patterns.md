Overhype example.**

---

## Duplicate source of truth

**Looks like:** two places that both claim to define the same concept (two prompt
builders, two enrichment blobs, a cached copy that drifts from the live value).
**Dangerous:** they diverge silently; a fix to one leaves the other wrong; nobody
knows which is authoritative. **Avoid:** identify the single source of truth for
every concept you touch (the plan's *Source-of-Truth Analysis*) and route
everything through it. **Overhype:** `facts.*` is the sole *active* enrichment
truth — `fact_enrichment_versions` is an archive, not lineage. The visual
**compiler** owns identity/text-policy language; the planner must not re-author it.

## A test asserting what you believe a producer emits, instead of what it emits

**Looks like:** a test that hardcodes the producer's output — a marker value, a
slug, a character class — from your understanding of the producer rather than
from the producer itself. It passes. **Dangerous:** it doesn't just fail to
catch a broken contract, it **actively enforces the broken version**, so the
suite is greenest exactly when the contract is most broken. Both halves of a
producer/consumer pair can be individually tested, both green, and the pair
still dead. **Avoid:** for any generated artifact, assert against the **real
committed output** run through the **real consumer** — import the generated
module, pull the actual values out of it, and feed them to the actual guard. If
a test names a literal the producer emits, that literal is a belief, and beliefs
in tests are how this happens. **Overhype:** PR #472 hit this three times in one
build. (1) A test asserted `data-help-internal="true"` while the consumer had
been changed to read a *path* out of that attribute — every in-app Manual link
was silently inert, with that test and the consumer's own unit test both
passing, because neither touched the artifact. (2) A test asserted
`#emoji-🎉-heading` was a producible heading slug; `github-slugger` strips emoji
and actually emits `emoji--heading`. (3) Two successive hand-written Unicode
character classes for "what the slugger emits" were each measured wrong — the
first excluded 1164 characters it really emits, the second still excluded 61.
The fix in each case was to stop describing the producer and start executing it.

**The same shape, one level up: describing a GUARD's coverage from the part of
it you read.** A doc, a decision entry or a PR body that states what a check
protects is making a claim about that check's *inputs* — which file list it
walks, which paths it classifies, which branches it exempts — and those live in
a different part of the file from the logic you were reading. Two instances in
two review rounds on the same afternoon: *"`classify-ci-paths.mjs` treats all of
`docs/**` as inert"* (it carries an explicit `ADMIN_FIELD_REFERENCE.md`
exception, for the symmetric reason) and *"a green `check:docs` means every
prefixed path resolves"* (it runs on a five-entry library list, so `docs/tests`,
`CLAUDE.md` and all of `.agents/memory/` are outside it). Both read as
confident, both were wrong in the **over**-claiming direction, and an
over-claimed guard is the dangerous direction — it tells the next reader they're
covered where they aren't. **Avoid:** before writing what a guard covers, read
the collection it iterates and the exemptions it applies, not just the rule it
enforces. If the sentence names a scope, that scope is a claim, and claims get
checked against the source.

## A guard that matches spelling instead of resolving bindings fails open

**Looks like:** a static check that recognises its target by name — counting
`setLocation(` occurrences, matching a callee called `useLocation`, grepping for
an import string. **Dangerous:** it fails in the **open** direction. Renaming or
aliasing produces a fully functional second path that the guard cannot see, and
because the *original* spelling is usually still present somewhere, the guard's
own "did I find anything?" assertion stays satisfied — so it reports green while
certifying the exact regression it exists to prevent. **Avoid:** resolve the
**binding**, not the text — follow a destructuring to whatever name it binds,
and follow an import specifier (`propertyName ?? name`) to whatever the module
actually exported. And give the guard **bypass fixtures**: mutate a copy of the
source to introduce the violation and require the analysis to object, with an
assertion that the mutation actually applied — a fixture whose `.replace()`
silently no-ops is itself a vacuous test. **Overhype:** PR #472's navigation
guard, three versions deep. v1 counted `setLocation(` and was defeated by
`const [, navigate] = useLocation()`; v2 resolved the destructuring but matched
the hook by callee text and was defeated by
`import { useLocation as useHelpLocation }`; v3 resolves the import specifier.
Each version's guards-the-guard assertion passed throughout, because token
presence is not the property being guarded. See
`artifacts/overhype-me/src/components/admin/helpNavigationGuard.test.ts`.

## Preview/runtime mismatch

**Looks like:** an admin preview that shows something different from what
production actually renders/sends. **Dangerous:** moderators approve based on the
preview; if it lies, they ship the wrong thing. **Avoid:** previews and production
must call the **same** core path; feed previews a canonical test identity. **Overhype:**
the Runtime Compiled Prompt preview and production both go through
`assembleImagePromptForPreview()` → `generateImagePromptPlan()` +
`compileForSubjectRenderMode()`. The two preview surfaces once diverged by
hardcoding different names ("David" vs "David Franklin"); standardized on
`RUNTIME_PREVIEW_DEFAULT_NAME`. (Residual prose difference is **temperature 0.4**,
not caching — don't misdiagnose it.) See
`visual-pipeline.md`.

## Human override overwrite

**Looks like:** AI reprocessing (re-enrich, backfill) clobbers a moderator's
manual decision. **Dangerous:** silently destroys human judgment and moderation
audit trail; erodes trust in the whole pipeline. **Avoid:** keep AI-derived and
human-override layers separate; re-processing refreshes only the AI baseline and
preserves overrides; bulk jobs skip admin-edited rows unless explicitly forced.
**Overhype:** `enrichmentAiDerived` (immutable) vs `enrichmentOverrides`
(path-keyed) merged by `resolveEnrichment()`; `runEnrichmentForFact` is "sticky";
`factEnrichmentBackfillJob` skips admin-edited rows unless
`forceOverwriteAdminEdited`. See
`taxonomy-and-enrichment.md`.

## Raw AI context injected into the final prompt

**Looks like:** dumping enrichment fields (cultural references, semantic entities,
modifier prose) straight into the engine prompt as meta-instructions. **Dangerous:**
leaks brand names / meta-instructions into the image, and creates a second prompt
channel behind the planner's back. **Avoid:** enrichment is a planner **input**;
let the planner + compiler decide what reaches the engine. **Overhype:** cultural
references / semantic entities are deliberately NOT re-emitted as "Interpret X
means Y" lines in `nanoBanana2.ts`; modifier directives are conservatively de-duped
against the assembled prompt.

## Manual `api-zod/src/index.ts` export silently reverted by codegen

**Looks like:** you add a new module under `lib/api-zod/src/` and add
`export * from "./yourModule"` to `lib/api-zod/src/index.ts`; typecheck and your
targeted tests pass, so you move on. Then a later step that runs codegen (the
full test suite's setup, `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen`, a
merge, a build) **regenerates `index.ts`** and your export line vanishes.
**Dangerous:** `@workspace/api-zod` resolves to `./src/index.ts` (see its
`package.json` `exports`), so the moment the export is gone **every consumer
breaks at runtime** with `does not provide an export named '…'` — and it looks
like a broad, mysterious cascade (dozens of unrelated suites failing at load,
including ones that pass in isolation), not an export problem. Earlier green runs
were on a stale build that still had the export. **Root cause:** codegen OWNS
`api-zod/src/index.ts` — it rewrites the file from the allowlist in
`lib/api-spec/patch-generated.mjs`
(`apiZodIndexLines`). A hand-edit to `index.ts` is not a source of truth; the
allowlist is. **The real fix:** add the new module to the `apiZodIndexLines`
array in `patch-generated.mjs`, then run codegen and confirm the export survives
(`git diff --exit-code lib/api-zod/src/index.ts` is clean after codegen).
`git checkout lib/api-zod/src/index.ts` restores the committed (correct) version
if a codegen run clobbers your working tree mid-session. Do **not** try to "just
re-add it to index.ts" — it will be reverted again.

**Recurred (PR #228):** added `export * from "./factTextEdit"` directly to
`index.ts` mid-session, verified with `tail`/`grep` and passing targeted tests,
and moved on without adding the line to `patch-generated.mjs`. CI's `pretest`
ran codegen and wiped it — surfaced as 9–10 unrelated test files across
multiple shards failing to even load (`visualConceptJobs`, `phase4.memes.save`,
`routes.admin.auth`, `routes.adminStripeSync`, `routes.facts`, …), exactly the
"broad, mysterious cascade" this entry already warned about. The doc existed
and was correct; it just wasn't consulted at the moment the new `lib/api-zod`
module was created. **The lesson isn't "read the doc harder" — it's a
mechanical check:** after adding *any* new file under `lib/api-zod/src/` (or
any export to an existing one), run
`pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` once, immediately, and confirm
`git diff --exit-code lib/api-zod/src/index.ts` is clean, before writing a
single consumer of that export. Don't defer this verification to "when I run
the full test suite later" — by then the mistake is buried under unrelated
work and looks like a cascade of broken tests, not a one-line miss.

**Now automated (2026-07-23, PR #236):** a doc reminder didn't stop this from
recurring once already (PR #228), so the mechanical check above is no longer
opt-in. CI's `Build` job runs `pnpm run check:codegen-drift`
(`scripts/check-codegen-drift.sh`) on
every PR, which reruns codegen and fails the merge on any resulting drift —
same command works locally. **One correctness detail if you ever touch that
guard:** it checks `git status --porcelain -- lib/`, not
`git diff --exit-code -- lib/`. A `git diff` only sees modified *tracked*
files; when codegen splits out a brand-new generated file, that file is
*untracked*, and a diff-only guard would silently pass while the merged
checkout is still missing it (caught in Codex review on PR #236 — see
`code-review.md`'s Tests section for the general principle this became).

## Stale historical docs treated as current truth

**Looks like:** implementing from an old note (or training-data memory) that no
longer matches the repo. **Dangerous:** you rebuild something already removed, or
reintroduce a retired rule. **Avoid:** prefer, in order — David's latest
instruction, current repo implementation, recently merged plans, then old context
as background only. Verify; where you can't, ask. **Overhype (retired assumptions
NOT to reintroduce):** blanket "no readable text"; `gpt-4o-mini`/`gpt-image-1`/FLUX
as the render path; enrichment-time visual preview as source of truth; violence
auto-softeners; `enrichment_pending` stage name (it's `prep_pending`).

## A hand-maintained note describing emergent behaviour

**Looks like:** a comment or contract paragraph that describes what a system
*does*, where the behaviour is not implemented in one place but emerges from
several independent rules. **Dangerous:** the description is accurate the day
it is written and silently stops being accurate as the rules change, while
reading exactly as authoritative as it did before. Nothing fails; the note is
just wrong, and it is wrong in the file a future session trusts most.

**PR #488 is the sustained example: one paragraph was wrong in four
consecutive review rounds while the behaviour it described never changed
once.** Too narrow (named one rule), too narrow again (named three, missed a
fourth), then falsely universal ("any protected command is refused" — one
inert leading word defused it), then falsely positional ("the first word
decides" — wrapper and env-assignment prefixes are stripped first).

**Four things that generalize, in the order they had to be learned:**

1. **A limitation goes stale when a rule is added ABOVE it or removed BENEATH
   it**, and removal is the direction nobody re-reads for. #488's heredoc note
   described a fix that a later revert had removed; `CLAUDE.md` simultaneously
   described a receipt guarantee that had been split out one commit earlier.
2. **The author of a change is its least reliable narrator.** Both of those
   were written by the person who had just made the change, describing it from
   the example that prompted it rather than from its blast radius.
3. **Widening a too-narrow claim's quantifier is not a fix.** "Some of these"
   and "all of these" are both outcome claims and both go stale; #488 went from
   the first to the second and got a counter-example in one round.
4. **Replacing prose with a formula does not make the formula checked.** The
   fix that finally held was an invariant executed against real inputs — but
   it was first written one level above where it runs (`decide(...)` rather
   than the command text the tests actually compare), so for one round it
   *looked* verified and was not.

**Avoid:** when behaviour is emergent, state an **invariant that can be
executed** rather than a description that must be maintained, and state it at
the boundary the test actually exercises. #488's note is now one line — an
array literal gets exactly the verdict its words get as a command — pinned
against 19 inputs.

**What that buys, stated exactly, because overstating it would be this very
pattern again:** the *claim* stays true as rules are added, where all four
prose descriptions went false. The *coverage* does not — the 19 cases are a
hand-curated list, so a new rule whose inputs aren't represented in it can
behave differently inside an array with every invariant test still green.
**Adding a rule therefore still requires adding a representative case**, or
deriving the list from the rule set rather than maintaining it by hand. An
invariant narrows what can drift from "a paragraph" to "the sample"; it does
not eliminate drift, and saying otherwise recreates the false assurance this
section is about. (Codex caught exactly that overstatement in the first draft
of this entry.)

**Also avoid:** claiming in a test file that its rows protect a *prose* claim.
They do not — assertions check runtime verdicts, and the branch shipped 236
green tests beside a header statement that was already refuted.

### The second sustained example, and the repair move the entry was missing

**PR #430 ran the same pattern over a *prescribed command* rather than a
behaviour description.** One line — how to run the plan-entry inventory — was
corrected in round after round, each fix locally correct and each leaving the
class alive. **The counts are deliberately not repeated here**: PR #430's own
thread is the canonical account, and this entry had three different numbers in
circulation against it before that was noticed — which is this section's
durable-text rule failing inside the section that states it. The sequence is
what generalizes, not its length:

`grep -rn` over-counts (walks `.git`, `node_modules`, generated output) →
`rg` under-counts (skips hidden directories, where this repo keeps its process
sources) → `--hidden` puts `.git` back → `--glob '!.git'` still under-counts
(ripgrep honours VCS ignore rules, so a tracked-but-gitignored file is
invisible) → an offered alternative that searched *filenames* rather than
contents.

**The written counts went stale the same way, with a twist worth its own
sentence: a count written into the tree it measures is false at its own
commit.** Quoting a probe string in the explanation made the explanation a
hit, so "returns zero files" was wrong the moment it was committed — repeatedly,
and more often found by an adjudicator verifying the claim than by a review
round reading it.

**The repair move this entry did not previously name.** Point 3 above says
widening a quantifier is not a fix. The general form is stronger: **when
successive locally-correct corrections keep leaving the class intact, the
defect is the claim's *shape*, and the fix is to remove the shape rather than
correct the claim a further time.** Concretely, #430's terminal move was three
deletions and one promotion:

- **state the property, not the command** — the oracle's corpus must be the
  tracked set; a command is one example that satisfies it, and the property
  survives every tool change that broke five prescriptions;
- **keep exactly one example**, because a second is a second chance to be
  wrong — and it was;
- **cite a delta and a mechanism, never a total — *in durable text*.** "Misses
  this tracked file that `git grep` finds", "honours ignore rules". A count
  committed into the tree it measures is false at its own commit; a delta and a
  mechanism stay true as the tree changes. **A per-run receipt is the opposite
  case and keeps its count**: [`working-modes.md`](working-modes.md)'s
  inventory statement ("N hits, list attached") records the instant it
  measured, and that count is the evidence a reviewer needs to tell "there was
  nothing to find" from "this was never done."

**How to recognise it in time:** the signal is not the finding count, which
rose and fell and rose again. It is **the same claim being corrected a third
time**. At three, stop fixing and ask what
*kind* of sentence keeps being wrong. The section that came out of #430 is
[`working-modes.md`](working-modes.md)'s affected-surface inventory; the
residuals it shipped knowingly are #516 and #519.

## An example is a prescription with deniability

**Looks like:** a contract states a rule, then offers an example to illustrate
it — and the example is wrong, incomplete, or doesn't actually satisfy the
rule. It reads as harmless, because it is *only* an example: the normative
content is the rule above it, and the example is just there to help.

**Dangerous:** readers execute examples. An agent reading a process document
does not weigh the illustrative status of a command before running it — it
runs the command, because the command is the runnable part. So a defective
example is a defective prescription with a layer of deniability wrapped
around it, and the deniability is what stops it being fixed with the urgency
it deserves.

**The worked instance, and the ruling.** PR #430's inventory section stated a
property (the oracle's corpus must be the tracked set) and then offered two
examples of commands satisfying it. One of them didn't — it searched filenames
rather than file contents, returning nothing for a pattern present in several
tracked files. I argued this was distinguishable from "the section still
prescribes a wrong command," because a stopping condition turned on that
distinction. **A fresh-context adjudication called that rationalising**, and
was right: the distinction has no operational content on the reader's side.

**Two consequences worth keeping:**

1. **An example inherits the full correctness obligation of the rule it
   illustrates** — and if you are not willing to verify it to that standard,
   remove it rather than caveat it. #430's fix was deletion, not correction:
   one example, deliberately.
2. **"It's only an example" is a rationalisation, not a defence**, and it is
   most tempting exactly when a stopping rule or a decline turns on it. Treat
   reaching for it as the signal to put the question to an independent
   assessment rather than settling it in your own head.

**Avoid:** shipping an example you have not verified, in any document an agent
will act on. The check is that an example offered to illustrate a property must
itself demonstrably satisfy that property — stated locally in
[`working-modes.md`](working-modes.md)'s affected-surface inventory, and
generalized here because the failure is not specific to search oracles.

**Verified, not necessarily executed — and the difference is a safety rule,
not a hedge.** Plenty of examples in this repo's agent-facing docs are
state-changing or destructive: a migration, a branch deletion, a force push,
`publish_app`. **Running one merely to validate the documentation would cause
the harm the surrounding guidance exists to prevent**, so:

**The default is: do not execute it. Verify by reading** — the implementation,
the tool's own contract, each flag against its documentation. Record what you
read.

**Executing is the exception, and it carries a burden of proof**: run the
example only if you can state, in one sentence, why it has **no effect outside
your own working tree** — no writes, no network, no external service, staging
and third-party included. If you cannot write that sentence, you do not have
the exception; you have a guess.

**This replaced a three-branch taxonomy, and the replacement is the point.**
The branch version was corrected in three consecutive review rounds and each
round found a *different* gap: a dry-run flag that satisfied both a permissive
and a restrictive branch; an overlap rule that said the wrong branch won; and
a read-only call against a staging service that matched **no** branch at all.
Each fix was locally correct and left the shape intact — which is precisely
the failure the entry two sections above describes, so the repair is the one
that entry prescribes: **remove the claim's shape.** A taxonomy of safe cases
has a gap for every case nobody enumerated, and the gaps fail *open*. One
default plus a burden of proof has no gaps, because anything unclassified
lands on the default, and the default is the safe side.

**And treat a destructive example as a reason to reconsider including it.**
It is simultaneously the case where a wrong example does the most damage and
the case where the cheapest verification is unavailable — which usually means
describing the operation and pointing at the runbook beats pasting a runnable
command into a document an agent will act on.

*(This exception was itself a review finding on this entry: the first draft
said "execute every example," which is a universal claim that fails for a
whole class — the entry two sections above, on exactly that. Recorded rather
than quietly corrected, because the entry earning its own findings on its
first round is the most useful thing about it.)*

## A verification step placed where it cannot physically run

**Looks like:** writing a workflow that gates step N on evidence only
producible at step N+1 — most often treating post-merge verification as a
pre-merge gate. **Dangerous:** the contract reads as *more* rigorous, so it
survives review on its plausibility; in practice it either deadlocks (waiting
for evidence that cannot exist) or gets silently ignored, and the real gate
goes undefined. **Avoid:** for every check in a workflow, ask *where does the
thing being tested physically live at this moment, and can the tester reach
it?* **Overhype:** the app runs from the Repl, and the Repl tracks `main`, so
**everything that tests running behavior is post-merge** — David's UAT and
Replit's `TEST_RUN` alike (the one later exception is a `prototype/<feature>`
branch, tested on its own prototype environment with no merge at all —
[`working-modes.md`](./working-modes.md#the-prototype-phase-per-feature-david-2026-09-26)).
Merge + sync is what makes a build testable;
production is the separate, deferred `publish_app` step. This misfired twice
in one day on PR #413 (2026-08-11): Codex caught a `TEST_RUN`-as-merge-gate
example, and David caught the same shape in the close-out contract two turns
later, where the merge was gated on a UAT the merge is a prerequisite for.

## Async enqueue treated as completion

**Looks like:** reporting a job "done" when it was only *queued*; a single global
spinner for a bulk action. **Dangerous:** the user thinks work finished (or
failed) when it's still running; per-item failures/skips get hidden. **Avoid:**
poll the job's terminal state and show per-item + aggregate status — the full
contract is [`async-ui-status.md`](./async-ui-status.md); read it before building
any queued/bulk surface. **Overhype:** the async queue is `async_jobs` (`pending →
processing → done | failed`); **Taxonomy Health (`useTaxonomyHealthActions.ts`) is
the reference implementation** — copy it, don't invent a new status channel.

**A second, subtler version: a `done` job whose HANDLER-level result was
actually a skip.** A bulk-action picker can pre-skip an obviously ineligible
target before enqueueing (visible today via `outcomes`), but a job's own
handler can *also* discover mid-run that the work doesn't apply (e.g. a race —
the target became ineligible between pick and run) and complete successfully
with a skip result. If the job-status contract only reports `pending |
processing | done | failed`, that terminal skip renders as a plain "Done" —
exactly the "skipped collapsed into a checkmark" bug this whole doc's rule
forbids, just one layer deeper than the obvious case. **Avoid:** if a job
handler can return `{ok:true, result:{skipped:true, reason}}`, the job-status
endpoint must surface that (sanitized — validate the reason against a known
enum, never echo the raw result blob) and the polling hook must render it as
`skipped`, not `done`. **Overhype:** `factSendBackJob.ts`'s
`REFRESH_ALREADY_IN_PROGRESS` recovery path is exactly this case; PR #205
extended `JobStatusEntry`/`useTaxonomyHealthActions` with `{skipped,
skipReason}` to close the gap — for both the new send-back queue and any
future job handler that skips mid-run.

## Unbounded id list into a DB guard query

**Looks like:** a bulk/fan-out action recomputes its target set by loading
**all** matching rows into JS memory (the established pattern here — the
evaluator/picker architecture can't push its logic into SQL), then passes that
**entire** id list into a follow-up `inArray(...)` guard query (e.g. "which of
these are already in-flight / have an active variant") **before** applying the
action's own batch cap. **Dangerous:** the guard query's size is bounded only
by how much of the corpus currently matches — which can be the *whole active
table* (e.g. right after a corpus-wide invalidation), risking a query past
practical bind/parameter limits or a timeout, silently failing the endpoint
and enqueuing nothing even though the action only needed a small, capped
batch. Easy to miss because it works fine in dev/testing with a handful of
rows. **Avoid:** chunk any `inArray(...)` call whose input size scales with
corpus size (not with the request's own bound), and prefer resolving only as
many eligible targets as the cap needs rather than classifying the entire
candidate set up front, when the two aren't in tension (see the cap-vs-exact-
remaining-count trade-off noted below). **Overhype:**
`factsWithInFlightRefresh`/`factsWithActiveVariants` in
`adminTaxonomyHealth.ts` chunk their guard queries at 500 ids/query
(`GUARD_QUERY_CHUNK_SIZE`) rather than passing the full stale-for-reprocess id
set (which the Stale-for-reprocess card's own docs note can be "nearly the
whole corpus," especially after a "Mark major update" bump) in one call —
caught by Codex review on PR #205, not by the original tests (which only
exercised small id sets). See
`taxonomy-and-enrichment.md`.

## Dedupe key coalesces two distinct intents

**Looks like:** a "force / fresh / regenerate" async action reuses the same stable
`dedupeKey` an idempotent path uses, so `enqueueJob` returns the *existing*
non-terminal job instead of scheduling new work — the fresh intent silently
attaches to (and is satisfied by) stale in-flight work. **Dangerous:** the user
thinks they triggered a new batch/run; they got the old one's result. A stable key
is a correctness tool for idempotency and a correctness *hazard* for "do it again."
**Avoid:** enqueue force/regenerate work with **no dedupe key** (or a
per-invocation one) so it can never coalesce, and move the double-click/concurrency
guard to the **state transition** itself (an atomic compare-and-set) rather than
relying on the queue. Separately, block a *new* cycle from starting while the prior
job is still non-terminal, so there's no in-flight job for it to coalesce onto.
**Overhype:** `enqueueJob` returns the existing pending/processing row for a
matching `(queue, dedupeKey)` (`async_jobs`); "approve the visual gag" therefore
force-enqueues `review_render_scenarios_prepare` with **no** key and guards the
`concept_review → production_review` advance with a compare-and-set — two
concurrent approvals yield exactly one force batch. Re-prep/regenerate is blocked
while `visual_concept_status = "pending"` for the same reason. See
`moderation-workflow.md` and the PR #179 decision in
[`decisions.md`](./decisions.md).

## Repairing state on a caught async error races the thing it's repairing

**Looks like:** an enqueue helper writes optimistic status (e.g. `"pending"`)
before calling `enqueueJob`, then on a caught error rewrites that status to a
terminal value (e.g. `"failed"`) so the UI doesn't strand at "working."
**Dangerous:** `enqueueJob` can throw even when a job genuinely got created —
its own dedupe-conflict recovery has a narrow insert-retry race of its own — so
a caught error doesn't reliably mean "no job exists." An unconditional
repair-write can clobber a legitimately in-flight (or already-finished) job's
real status before it's ever observed. Even a "check first, then repair" fix
(SELECT for an in-flight job, then UPDATE only if none found) has its own
TOCTOU gap: the job can go terminal, or another writer can write its own
terminal status, in the window between the SELECT and the UPDATE. **Avoid:**
fold every condition the repair depends on into **one atomic UPDATE** — the
state is still what you last wrote AND no non-terminal row exists for the
dedupe key — evaluated in the same statement's `WHERE` clause (a `NOT EXISTS`
subquery), not a prior read. **Overhype:** `enqueueFactPexels`/
`enqueueFactAiMemeBackfill` (`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/factPexelsJobs.ts`,
`aiMemeBackfillJobs.ts`, PR #256) took three rounds of review to converge on
this: round 1 added an unconditional repair (wrong — clobbers a concurrent
success), round 2 added a SELECT-then-UPDATE (still racy), round 3 replaced
both with a single `UPDATE ... WHERE status = 'pending' AND NOT EXISTS
(SELECT 1 FROM async_jobs WHERE queue=? AND dedupe_key=? AND status IN
('pending','processing'))`.

## One-example bug fixes

**Looks like:** patching only the exact reported sentence/case instead of the
general mechanism. **Dangerous:** the class of bug remains; it resurfaces with the
next input. **Avoid:** fix the mechanism and add a test that asserts the
**invariant**, with negative cases. **Overhype:** the tokenizer's
`autoConjugatePersonSubjectVerbs` net solves the *general* "person-subject verb
must agree" rule (not just "They keeps"), with a narrow anchor so it never
mis-wraps non-person subjects ("Sharks have …"), plus idempotency tests. See
`token-rendering-and-grammar.md`.

### When the mechanism cannot be fixed either: abandon the layer

The advice above assumes a general mechanism exists to fix. Sometimes the
"general rule" is another program's entire command-line grammar, and then
fixing the mechanism and matching the instance are the same move wearing a
better argument. **PR #488 is the worked example: five attempts to enumerate
were started and all five were abandoned** — curl's option grammar, an
allowlisted probe exception, a widened `LOOKS_DESTRUCTIVE`, a replacement
heredoc delimiter scanner, and an array-assignment suppression. Each was
locally reasonable, each closed the reported case, and each produced the next
round's finding.

**Abandoned does not uniformly mean deleted, and the split is 3 / 2.** Three
were removed outright: curl's option grammar (`isGitHubApiUrl` and the whole
`rest.some(...)` argument-inspection branch, gone from the merged file — zero
occurrences remain), the probe exception, and the array suppression. Two
survive in their original, deliberately incomplete form with their gaps
recorded — `LOOKS_DESTRUCTIVE` and an identifier-shaped `HEREDOC_RE` — and what
was abandoned there is only the attempt to make them *general*: widening the
regex to cover fetchers, and replacing the delimiter class with a full scanner.

That distinction is worth the sentence because it cuts both ways for a
maintainer. "All five were deleted" sends them looking for code that is plainly
still there; "none were deleted" implies the enumerations were merely paused.
And the direction matters for a guard specifically: **refusing the class means
stop trying to complete a mechanism, not delete every mechanism that partially
works** — the second reading is a licence to remove protective code, which is
the one direction this module must never move in.

**Three signals that you are in this situation rather than the ordinary one:**

- **The counter-examples come from a different sub-language every time.** #488
  round 4 produced findings in wgetrc directives, `--connect-to` composites,
  brace URL globbing, long-option prefix abbreviation, and `--variable`
  interpolation. That is not a bug with variants; it is a parser you have
  agreed to reimplement without noticing.
- **Your fixes start failing at the rate you make them.** Round 16 made four
  small fixes; round 17 found a defect in all four. Count it — the ratio is
  the evidence, and it is far more reliable than the feeling that this next
  one is obviously right.
- **The exception has the same surface as the rule.** #488 kept one allowlisted
  probe URL and got three findings against that single exception in one round,
  including a config file (`$CURL_HOME/.curlrc`) that adds requests which never
  appear in argv at all — unfixable by argument inspection, because the thing
  being inspected is not there.

**Avoid:** refuse the whole class instead of judging instances of it. #488's
decision module (scripts/guard-decision.mjs, since retired — #94) refused
`curl` and `wget` with
no argument-shape exception, because that is the only version that is complete
by construction. Accept and **write down** the residual gaps rather than
closing them one at a time.

**Scoped to the module deliberately, and this sentence is itself an instance of
the pattern below.** The refusal lived in that decision module, which
.claude/guard.sh ran *only when `node` was available*; the node-less fallback
had no fetcher alternative and let a `curl` payload through. An earlier
version of this paragraph said the guard "refuses `curl` and `wget` outright"
with no qualifier — a blanket claim about a wrapper that does no such thing,
written in the entry warning against exactly that. It survived a repo-wide
sweep for the *neighbouring* class because it used none of the swept words.
(Codex, #499 round 4.)

**One asymmetry worth keeping, because it is what finally converged:**
**deleting an allow-producing rule cannot open a hole**, while adding
interpretation can — so when a guard is oscillating, removal is the safe move
and refinement is not. State that narrowly: it is true of a removal proven
monotonic in the restrictive direction against the assertion table, **not** of
deletions generally (deleting a *protective* branch turns blocks into allows).

## Regex grammar rewrite reaches past a safe anchor

**Looks like:** a deterministic text-rewrite rule (regex-based grammar/token
repair) is extended to "walk into" a syntactically similar but semantically
different region — e.g. auto-*wrapping* a verb across a coordinating
conjunction on the assumption the subject is unchanged. **Dangerous:** regex has
no semantic understanding; it can't tell "and hides" (same subject) from "and
dogs bark" (a new subject) — the rewrite silently corrupts input that merely
*looks* similar. **Avoid:** keep a rewrite that *creates* a token anchored to a
position where the subject is unambiguous (immediately after the trigger
token); prefer "no rewrite" over "wrong rewrite" when reach would require
guessing. A rewrite that only *collapses* an existing token can safely reach
further, because it can be bounded by a strict stop-set (any brace or
clause-boundary punctuation) without needing to positively identify the new
construct. **Overhype:** the tokenizer's conjugation net
(`autoConjugatePersonSubjectVerbs`) stays adjacency-only — it will not walk a
coordination chain to *wrap* a later verb, because `{Subj} runs and dogs bark`
is indistinguishable from `{Subj} runs and hides` by regex alone; the AI prompt
(not the deterministic net) is responsible for coordinated verbs. The
complementary `{NAME}`-subject *collapse*
(`collapseNameSubjectConjugationPairs`) safely reaches further because it only
removes an existing pair, bounded by clause/brace/punctuation stops — it never
creates a new wrap. See
`token-rendering-and-grammar.md`.

## Uniform default over a falsely-ambiguous space

**Looks like:** a deterministic normalization pass treats an entire class of
input as "ambiguous" and picks one default reading for all of it — but a
subset of that class actually has a knowable, unambiguous answer that the
chosen default gets wrong. **Dangerous:** the fallback *looks* safe ("the more
common reading") and passes tests built around the reported example, but
silently corrupts the subset it's actually wrong for — which can be common in
casual English, not a rare edge case. **Avoid:** before picking a uniform
default, ask "is there a narrow, high-confidence signal that resolves *part*
of this space with certainty?" — carve that subset out with its own rule, and
default only the genuinely irreducible remainder. **Overhype:**
`expandSubjectContractions()` originally defaulted every `'s` contraction to
the copula `{is|are}`, reasoning that is/has ambiguity is "the far more common
reading" — but "'s got"/"'s been"/"'s had" can ONLY mean "has" ("is
got"/"is been"/"is had" isn't grammatical English), so the uniform default was
silently producing "They are got the keys" for they/them. Caught by code
review (Codex), not by the shipped tests — they proved the chosen default
worked for the genuinely ambiguous remainder, but never asked whether the
assumed-ambiguous set was actually uniform. Fixed with
`HAS_ONLY_FOLLOWING_WORDS`, a small next-word peek that resolves the
unambiguous subset before falling back to the copula for truly ambiguous words
(e.g. "done"). See
`token-rendering-and-grammar.md`.

## Migration/backfill blind spots

**Looks like:** a schema/data change that ignores old rows, partial states,
failures, skips, or no-ops; a non-idempotent backfill. **Dangerous:** half-migrated
data, silent data loss, un-rerunnable scripts, no visibility into what changed.
**Avoid:** reason explicitly about old/new/partial/failed/skipped/no-op rows; make
backfills idempotent; expose counts. **Overhype:** `drizzle-kit generate` is
broken, so migrations use idempotent `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`; the
projection-repair job rewrites only derived columns and is safe to re-run. See
[`../engineering/migrations-and-backfills.md`](../engineering/migrations-and-backfills.md).

## Admin state ambiguity

**Looks like:** an admin surface that can't distinguish empty vs loading vs
running vs failed vs partial vs skipped vs complete vs no-op. **Dangerous:**
operators can't tell what happened or what to do next; they retry destructive
actions or assume success. **Avoid:** design every admin surface to show all the
states it can actually be in, plus the next action. **Overhype:** Taxonomy Health
cards name the issue, the count, and the remediation with a safety label
(costs-money vs safe/instant).

## Client-only permission assumptions

**Looks like:** gating a capability only in the frontend; trusting a client-sent
role/flag. **Dangerous:** trivially bypassed; privilege escalation, data exposure.
**Avoid:** enforce every permission **server-side**; the client gate is UX only.
**Overhype:** `requireAdmin`/`requireRole("admin")` guards every admin route; the
`AdminLayout` gate is convenience, not security. Auth also has real subtleties (see
`.agents/memory/auth-bearer-cookie-fallback.md`).

## Raw internal ID surfaced to a human

**Looks like:** an admin/audit UI attributes an action to "by {raw-id}" instead
of a name — a FK column or a jsonb-embedded provenance field (`createdBy`,
`updatedBy`, `performedBy`) rendered directly instead of resolved to a display
label. **Dangerous:** violates the hard rule that no internal ID/GUID may ever
reach a human-visible surface (admin included) — see
[`agent-working-rules.md`](./agent-working-rules.md#never-surface-a-raw-internal-id-anywhere-in-the-product);
also a sign the same write path may have sibling occurrences elsewhere.
**Avoid:** resolve to `displayName ?? email ?? (omit)` — never fall back to the
raw id; join at read time when the id lives in a real FK column, or stamp a
resolved label at write time when it's embedded in jsonb with no join path.
**Overhype:** the Facts admin's Enrichment Version History panel rendered
`factEnrichmentVersionsTable.createdBy` raw; the Enrichment Editor's "Last
edited by" line rendered `visualPromptStrategyOverride.updatedBy` raw. Both
fixed; pre-existing jsonb-stamped rows from before the fix may still hold a raw
id until next edited (a backfill would be separate migration-shaped work).

## Cost-skip heuristic checks one signal, misses a co-equal one

**Looks like:** an optimization heuristic that skips an expensive step when
"nothing is left to do" checks for ONE signal of remaining work (e.g. a plain
subject name) but not a co-equal signal that would ALSO require the same step
(e.g. a plain subject pronoun). **Dangerous:** a mixed/partially-resolved
input — some parts already correct, one signal class still plain — passes the
"nothing left to do" check and permanently skips the only pass that would fix
it, silently hardcoding the miss instead of surfacing it. **Avoid:** when a
completion/skip heuristic checks for "is there personalizable/actionable
content remaining," enumerate every distinct signal class it would need to
act on and require ALL of them absent — not just the one that's cheapest or
most obvious to check. **Overhype:** the Visual-Concept-authoring batch
tokenize route's `isAlreadyTokenizedNoPlainName` skip predicate checked only
for a plain subject *name* — a moderator field partially tokenized via chips
(`"{NAME} holds his trophy"`) had no plain name left, so it reported "already
tokenized" and skipped the LLM call that would have converted "his,"
hardcoding the pronoun instead of resolving it per-render. Caught by a Codex
review before merge (PR #206); fixed by also requiring no plain subject
pronoun, mirroring the check the sibling `hasNoLikelySubjectReference`
predicate already had. See
`token-rendering-and-grammar.md`.

## Self-retriggering recovery with no bounded exit

**Looks like:** recovery / self-heal code that can *re-invoke the very action
that failed* — `window.location.reload()` on a failed dynamic import, an
auto-retry that re-runs on mount, a supervisor that restarts a crashed process
— with no state carried across the retrigger to stop it. **Dangerous:** a
transient upstream fault (a flapping dev server, a briefly-missing chunk, an
OOM kill) becomes an infinite, self-amplifying loop, because each retrigger
wipes in-memory state — a reload clears all JS; a process restart clears all
globals — so any guard kept in memory resets to "first try" every cycle and the
loop has no exit condition. This class slips **both** of Overhype's safety nets:
it's invisible to diff review (the defect is a *missing* guard, and it only
manifests under a runtime fault the review never simulates) and invisible to
David's product-testing (it's dev-infra, not a product surface). **Avoid:** any
code that can retrigger itself must carry a **bounded exit condition that
survives the retrigger** — persist a counter/timestamp somewhere that outlives
the recovery action (`sessionStorage` across a page reload; a rolling
`/tmp`/on-disk window across a process restart), cap the rate, and when the cap
trips **fail loud and settled** (surface an error boundary, or a give-up log
that names the real reason) instead of silently trying again. Prefer "stop and
show the error" over "reload again" whenever the fault could be persistent, and
make the crash reason durable so it isn't lost to a fast restart. **Overhype:**
`lazyWithRetry` (`artifacts/overhype-me/src/lib/lazy-retry.ts`) originally
called `window.location.reload()` unconditionally on a double import failure —
a flapping Vite dev server (esbuild thread exhaustion; see the `optimizeDeps`
notes in `artifacts/overhype-me/vite.config.ts`) turned that into a ~1.3s reload
loop that also tore down the HMR WebSocket. Fixed with a `sessionStorage`
reload-timestamp cooldown that rejects to the Sentry error boundary instead of
looping. `scripts/dev-supervisor.sh` is the process-level version done right: a
rolling 20-crashes-per-300s window (bookkept across restarts) that gives up
loudly — and now also captures + replays the child's last stderr and decodes the
exit signal, so a silent fast crash (the one that made the esbuild panic take
hours to find) is visible. The dev route-load smoke test
(`artifacts/overhype-me/e2e/routeLoadSmoke.spec.ts`) is the regression net for
the whole class. Full write-up in
[`decisions.md`](./decisions.md) is unnecessary; the fix lives in the three
anchors above.

## Over-engineered speculative abstractions

**Looks like:** building a framework/config system/plugin layer for a need that
doesn't exist yet, or expanding scope "while we're here." **Dangerous:** more
surface to maintain and break, slower to launch, harder to review. **Avoid:** make
the **smallest coherent change** that satisfies the approved plan; defer
speculative generality. **Overhype:** pre-launch priorities are stability + content
quality — new external vendors and new abstractions need a strong reason and
David's sign-off (see `product-direction.md`).

## Security classification by URL path instead of resolved authorization

**Looks like:** deciding a security posture (is this cacheable? cross-origin
embeddable? public?) from a route's path *shape* — an allowlist of URL patterns —
rather than from the ownership/visibility resolved for that specific response.
**Dangerous:** one path serves both public and private responses, so a pattern
match is wrong for half of them. `/api/memes/:slug/image` matches a public meme,
a **private** meme, AND the owner-gated `/api/memes/ai-user/image`; marking it
`cross-origin` by path leaks owner-only bytes (defeating CORP). The same shape
also produces path-traversal when a path param is interpolated into a storage
key (`video_style_previews/${id}.gif` with `id=../../x`). **Avoid:** classify at
the point visibility is *known* — one shared choke point that runs after the ACL
resolves — and derive any storage key from a sanitized/hashed form, never the raw
input. **Overhype:** cross-origin CORP is set in `setPublicCors()`
(`cacheHeaders.ts`), called *only* on confirmed-public responses; private
responses call `setNoStore` and stay `same-origin`. The style preview key goes
through `safeStylePreviewKey()`. See
`security-model.md` (C5/C9).

## Trusting self-set mutable metadata as a security assertion across a deploy

**Looks like:** an app writes a flag onto an object it controls (a Stripe PI's
`membership=true` metadata, a signed cookie claim, a DB column) and later reads
that flag back as *proof* of a security property. **Dangerous:** the flag was set
by an *older* version of the code with weaker rules, and in-flight objects
(pre-existing checkout sessions, cached tokens) carry it — so the new gate that
trusts the flag can be satisfied by a pre-staged object the old code stamped
wrongly. **Avoid:** verify the underlying fact from an authoritative,
non-self-set source at read time (the actual purchased product from the Checkout
Session line items), not the flag you wrote. **Overhype:** the one-time
membership grant reads `session.line_items[].price.product` and ignores the
`membership=true` PI stamp our own checkout set, closing the window where a
legacy pre-allowlist session mints Legendary after deploy. See
`security-model.md` (C6).

## Head-of-line blocking in a shared background worker

**Looks like:** one dispatch loop (one claim query, one concurrency pool, one
re-entrancy/"is it my turn" guard) processing several kinds of work that have
very different costs — some cheap and interactive, some slow and external.
**Dangerous:** a cheap, interactive action silently inherits the latency of
whatever expensive work happens to be queued or already running ahead of it —
looks like a hang or a broken feature, not a scheduling artifact, so it's hard
to diagnose from the symptom alone. A single shared re-entrancy guard makes it
worse: the *next* dispatch cycle can't even start until the *current* one's
entire batch — including any slow job in it — finishes. **Avoid:** when a
shared dispatcher serves work with meaningfully different latency profiles
(interactive vs. external-API vs. bulk-background), give each class its own
independent scheduling lane — own timer, own **closure-local** (never shared)
re-entrancy guard, own claim filter, own concurrency bound — so one lane can
never suppress another's progress. Don't just add more concurrency to the one
shared pool; that doesn't fix FIFO ordering starving a fast job behind older
slow ones. **Overhype:** the `async_jobs` worker (`asyncJobs.ts`) originally
drained all 9 queues through one loop; a pure-DB admin action (Taxonomy Health
"Send back to review," no model call) or a moderator-watched test render could
sit in "Queued…" for 30s+ behind unrelated LLM/image-gen or bulk-backfill work.
Fixed in PR #216 by splitting into `fast` / `render` / `bulk` lanes — see
[`decisions.md`](./decisions.md#2026-07--split-the-async-jobs-worker-into-fastrenderbulk-lanes)
and `architecture-map.md`.

A related engineering gotcha surfaced while fixing this — defaulting a new
lane-specific config knob to a fresh literal instead of the old shared knob's
resolved value — is in
`.agents/memory/env-knob-split-preserve-legacy-default.md`.

**A related but distinct lesson from the same claim-then-dispatch shape,
caught during NCMEC phase 3 review (PR #349, known gap G15, not yet built):**
`asyncJobsTick` stamps a whole claimed batch `processing` in one transaction
*before* `mapWithConcurrency` dispatches any row to a handler at limited
concurrency — so a row claimed late in a same-queue batch can queue for real
minutes before its own handler starts, even with no other queue involved at
all. Lane-splitting doesn't fix this one; it's within-queue, not cross-queue.
The lesson is narrower and specific to safety deadlines: **a wall-clock
invariant meant to bound total elapsed risk must be measured from the true
start of the risk window (claim time), not from a later sub-phase within it
(handler start)** — a test that only checks the sub-phase's own constant
against a cutoff can pass while the invariant it's protecting is still
violable. Tracked, not yet exploitable (no caller exists for the NCMEC
worker this would affect); phase 5's worker must bound elapsed time since
claim.

## A live FK's `ON DELETE SET NULL` can erase the fact an unrelated predicate depends on

**Looks like:** a predicate infers a historical fact ("did this row ever have
X") from a live column's *current* value ("is X currently non-null"), where
that column is the target end of a foreign key declared `onDelete: "set
null"`. **Dangerous:** an entirely unrelated action elsewhere in the app —
deleting the referenced row for its own, unconnected reasons — silently nulls
the column via the database's own cascade, with no application code path
that notices or logs it happening. The predicate then reads the row as
"never had X" instead of "had X, then lost it," and if the predicate gates a
security- or compliance-relevant decision, the wrong branch fires with
nobody having decided anything — it looks like normal operation from every
surface. **Avoid:** don't infer an immutable historical fact from a column
that participates in a live FK cascade; capture the fact separately, once,
at the moment it's true, into a column nothing can silently null out from
under it. **Overhype:** `isIdentityUnresolved` (NCMEC phase 3,
`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/moderation/ncmecWorker.ts`) infers "this row's uploader identity was
never captured" from `reporterSnapshot === null && userId !== null` — but
`ncmec_reports.user_id` has `onDelete: "set null"`, and the pre-existing,
unrelated account hard-delete admin action (`routes/admin.ts`) runs
`db.delete(usersTable)`, which cascades. An admin hard-deleting the uploader
of a row correctly parked as `identity_unresolved` (a capture defect) turns
it into a row that reads as honestly anonymous and files automatically with
the uploader silently omitted — nobody having approved that. Caught in PR
#349's round-1 review before any caller existed to make it reachable;
tracked as known gap G14, needing an immutable snapshot-time capture that
the cascade can't touch (phase 4).

## Un-frozen input re-resolved live after its freeze point

**Looks like:** a value (identity, config, a selected option) is fixed at one
point in a pipeline — enqueue time, or a job's finalization — but a later
consumer (the worker that runs it, or a reader that classifies it afterward)
re-derives that same value **live** — a fresh DB query, a fresh config read —
instead of reading whatever was fixed at that earlier point.
**Dangerous:** if the underlying source changes in the window between the
freeze point and the later read (a profile edit, a config change, a row
deactivated, an admin raising a limit), the consumer silently uses the NEW
value while other parts of the same record (text already rendered, or a
status already decided from the OLD value) still reflect the old one —
producing output that is internally inconsistent with itself, and
non-reproducible (re-reading later can produce a different answer than it
would have at the freeze point). **Avoid:** resolve every input exactly ONCE,
at the point it's actually known, and persist a validated snapshot on the
job/row; every later consumer reads the snapshot and never re-queries the live
source for that input. **Overhype:**
- The `image_prompt_generation` worker re-queried the user's
  `displayName`/`pronouns` and re-resolved the selected look-style live on
  every run, even though the fact text had already been frozen at enqueue —
  a profile edit or a style edit/deactivation in that window could produce a
  render whose frozen fact text and whose live-resolved identity/style
  disagreed. Fixed by `prepareImagePromptAttemptInputs()` freezing a
  `PromptIdentitySnapshot` + `ResolvedRenderStyleSnapshot` once and rendering
  the fact text from that same identity (PR #223). See
  `visual-pipeline.md`.
- The Queue Health surface's `abandoned_no_retry` classification re-resolved
  a queue's retry ceiling from **current** `admin_config` at read time for
  any row still carrying the `0` sentinel (the common case — no per-row
  override). A row that legitimately exhausted retries under an old, lower
  ceiling would silently flip to `abandoned_no_retry` the moment an admin
  later raised that queue's limit — degrading *after* the fact,
  with no code change to explain it. Fixed by persisting the resolved
  ceiling onto the row at the one moment it's finalized to `failed` (PR
  #288); a pre-fix legacy row (still carrying the sentinel, since the
  migration doesn't backfill) is classified conservatively rather than risk
  the same bug on data that can't be resolved safely. See
  [`decisions.md`](./decisions.md#2026-07-30--queue-health-classification-persists-the-retry-ceiling-at-finalization-instead-of-re-deriving-it-live).

## Budget-constrained assembly blindly truncates wherever length lands

**Looks like:** an assembly pipeline builds output up to a hard character/token
ceiling, and when the assembled result overflows, it hard-cuts the END of the
string to fit — regardless of what content happens to be there.
**Dangerous:** if safety-critical content (a policy guardrail, a required
disclaimer, an exclusion rule) is emitted LAST — often because it's the final
"and don't do X" section — blind end-truncation can silently remove exactly
that content under budget pressure, while everything upstream of the cut still
looks fine. The failure is invisible until someone notices the guardrail
didn't apply. **Avoid:** never let a length ceiling silently drop
safety-critical content; either reserve budget for it so it always survives
truncation, or — safer — treat an overflow of required content as a hard
failure (fail loud, don't ship) instead of truncating at all. **Overhype:** the
Nano Banana 2 compiler's `assembleSections()` used to hard-truncate the fully
assembled prompt to `MAX_PROMPT_CHARS` as a last resort — and STRICT
CONSTRAINTS (the violence/text-policy safety guardrails) is the LAST section
emitted, so an overflow could cut exactly the guardrails. Retired in PR #224:
required-content overflow now surfaces `diagnostics.requiredBudgetOverflow`
and the async worker fails terminal (`required_budget_overflow`) instead of
shipping a truncated prompt; save-time validation (below) makes new
over-budget content essentially unreachable. See
`visual-pipeline.md`.

## Predicting a downstream system's output by summing raw component inputs

**Looks like:** a save-time (or any pre-flight) check needs to predict how big
/ long / expensive a downstream system's OUTPUT will be, and does it by summing
or estimating the raw INPUT components — without accounting for formatting,
wrapping, joins, labels, or other transformation the downstream system applies
on the way from input to output. **Dangerous:** the estimate systematically
undercounts, so content the pre-flight check accepts can still overflow/break
downstream — and the gap is invisible in code review, because the estimate
"looks reasonable" and the actual overflow only shows up at the OTHER end of
the pipeline, often much later. **Avoid:** when you must predict a downstream
system's real output, measure it by actually running (or a faithful,
minimal-diff invocation of) that system — don't hand-derive a proxy formula
that will drift the moment the downstream system's formatting changes.
**Overhype:** two instances in the same feature. (1) The compiler's fixed
required-section overhead is measured by literally compiling a maximum-shape
prompt through the real compiler (`measureRequiredPromptBudget()`), not
hand-estimated — this was right from the start. (2) The save-time check for a
moderator's "additions" content originally summed each field's raw projected
text length, missing the compiler's `"Do not …"` negation prefixes,
`"label: "` role-binding forms, `"; "`-joins, and per-section labels that only
appear once a field is populated — a save that check accepted could still
overflow at render. Caught by Codex mid-review (PR #224); fixed by
`measureModeratorAdditionsEmission()`, which compiles the fixed shape twice
(once with worst-case-projected content, once empty) and takes the delta, so
every fixed cost cancels and only the true additions contribution remains. See
`visual-pipeline.md`.

## Not merged ≠ not disclosed (public-repo PR history)

**Looks like:** using a branch or PR on a **public** repo as a "private" or
"throwaway" channel for content you never intend to ship — a plan, a draft, a
scratch file — assuming that because the PR is a *draft* or will be *closed
without merging*, its contents aren't really public. **Dangerous:** this repo is
public, so **every pushed commit and every closed-unmerged PR is permanently in
public history** — searchable, forkable, cached — regardless of draft status or
merge outcome. For content that describes an unpatched vulnerability, an exploit
path, secrets, private customer/commercial data, or embargoed work, that
*discloses* it the moment it's pushed, often before any fix ships. "It never
merged" buys **zero** privacy. **Avoid:** before pushing non-shippable content to
the public repo, run a disclosure check; route anything security-sensitive or
confidential to a private/manual channel instead of the public PR. Treat "draft"
and "will close unmerged" as no privacy at all. **Overhype:** the automated
plan-review loop (PR #226) deliberately uses a *never-merged public draft PR* as
its review channel — the first design had **no** disclosure gate, so a
security-remediation plan run through it would have published the exploit before
the fix landed. Fixed with a mandatory pre-open disclosure check that keeps such
plans off the public channel (see
[`decisions.md`](./decisions.md#2026-07-22--plan-review-automated-via-a-codex-draft-pr-loop-replaces-the-manual-chatgpt-paste)).
Compare PR #217 — a production DB dump that sat committed on public `main`.

## Security-relevant dependency claims written from assumption, not verification

**Looks like:** writing something confident and specific about a dependency's
security status into a durable doc — "no known CVE," "just a safe hygiene
bump," "these three patches are generic maintenance" — without actually
checking the package's changelog or advisory database first. **Dangerous:**
these claims read as authoritative once committed, so a later reader (a
`/maintenance` pass, a future agent, David) trusts them instead of re-checking,
and a real, disclosed CVE stays effectively invisible — mis-triaged as
low-priority precisely because the doc says it's safe. It compounds: an
unverified "safe" claim can gate a genuinely urgent fix behind an unrelated,
lower-priority blocker. **Avoid:** for any claim of the shape "no known
issue," "safe to defer," or "just hygiene," actually check — the package's own
changelog/GHSA/CVE listing, not memory or a plausible-sounding assumption — and
cite what was checked. Re-verify an existing claim before trusting it, same as
any other unverified product truth. **Overhype:** the original
`deferred-work.md` entry for the parked sharp bump (PR #243) asserted the
prior version "has no known CVE" — false; sharp inherits CVEs from libvips
(alert tagged `Direct`), just not the ones actually blocking the upgrade
(those were a typings regression). Separately, three *other* packages bundled
in that same PR (`drizzle-orm`, `vite`, `postcss`) were first filed as generic
"safe patch" hygiene, not worth prioritizing — until a full alert triage found
each closed a real, disclosed CVE, including a SQL injection in `drizzle-orm`,
the production ORM. (The same triage separately found and fixed CVEs in
`esbuild` and `fast-uri` too — not among these three, but part of the same
PR #246 sweep — bringing the total to 9 disclosed CVEs closed; see
[`decisions.md`](./decisions.md#2026-07-24--dependabot-alert-triage-found-the-safe-patch-bumps-parked-in-pr-243-were-actually-9-disclosed-cves-including-a-sql-injection-in-the-production-orm)
for the full breakdown.)

## Stripe plan selection: classify by price identity, not product identity

**Looks like:** turning Stripe's product/price catalog into "which plan is
this?" by inspecting the **product** — its name (string-matching "monthly" /
"annual" / "lifetime" / "forever" keywords) or just its first/cheapest price —
instead of inspecting **each price's own `recurring` field**. **Dangerous:**
Stripe's natural dashboard setup is one product with several price points
(e.g. a single "Legendary" product carrying monthly, annual, and one-time
prices together), so classifying by product collapses all of them into
whichever single bucket the product's name or first price happens to match,
silently dropping the others — a customer-facing plan picker can end up
showing only one price option even though the catalog has three. **Avoid:**
classify each price independently (`!recurring` → one-time, `recurring.interval
=== "month"` → monthly, `=== "year"` → annual) and never group by the parent
product. A second, adjacent trap: don't stop at classifying — also filter to
prices whose product carries the membership allowlist tag before doing so.
`/api/stripe/plans` returns **every** active product in the catalog (not just
membership ones), and the grant layer (`/stripe/checkout`, the confirm
endpoint, the webhook — see
`security-model.md`)
already enforces `overhype_membership=true` as the sole gate; a display/
selection surface that skips the same filter can advertise a future
non-membership SKU (render credits, merch, tips) as a Legendary plan, which
then gets rejected at checkout. **Overhype:** `Pricing.tsx`'s `classifyPlan()`
did the product-name/first-price version of this (PR #255) — a single
"Legendary" product with three attached prices showed only its "Forever"
one-time price, hiding monthly/annual. Codex review on the same PR caught the
missing-membership-filter half before it shipped. Both are now centralized in
`artifacts/overhype-me/src/pages/pricingPlans.ts`'s `selectPlanPrices()` —
filter to `overhype_membership` first, then classify each remaining price by
its own `recurring` field. See the decision in
[`decisions.md`](./decisions.md#2026-07-25--stripe-plan-selection-classifies-by-each-prices-own-recurring-field-and-only-from-membership-tagged-products).

## Persisted sync/job failure invisible after reload

**Looks like:** an admin sync/job progress panel that renders its per-resource
status only while a condition like `syncing || finalMessage || inProgress` is
true. **Dangerous:** all three go false the moment the page is left and
reloaded — so a per-resource `error` status the backend already computed,
persisted, and serves via its status endpoint is fetched and then silently
discarded. What remains on screen (a stale-but-plausible "N products found ·
last synced X ago") reads exactly like success, not "the last run partially
failed." **Avoid:** always render the last-known persisted state on load,
independent of whether a run is currently being watched — distinguish "last
run failed" from "last run succeeded, N ago" from "never run," per the admin
state-legibility rule in
[`async-ui-status.md`](./async-ui-status.md#admin-state-legibility).
**Overhype:** `stripeSyncRunner.ts`'s `readSyncStatus` correctly persists and
returns each resource's `status`/`error_message`; `billing.tsx`'s progress
panel just never rendered it outside an active run. This is why the "pricing
page shows only one plan" bug (see
[`decisions.md`](./decisions.md#2026-07-28--the-lifetime-only-upgrade-bugs-real-root-cause-was-a-silently-failed-stripe-sync-not-plan-selection-logic))
survived two unrelated code fixes (PR #255, #260), and re-running the sync
silently fixed it: the actual failure was never visible enough to investigate.

**A trap in how this was found, worth naming for future debugging:**
reproducing one layer of a suspected pipeline in isolation proves *that
layer* correct — it says nothing about whether the *live* run that produced
the current symptom actually succeeded. Confirming the sync library's storage
and read-query layers were faithful (by replaying its migrations and upsert
SQL locally) correctly ruled out the pricing-selection code, but was twice
over-read as "the sync is fine," when the live sync itself had simply failed
on an earlier run. The faster test that would have settled it sooner:
re-running the live operation and checking whether the symptom changes,
before building a from-scratch reproduction of its internals.

## A sample ordered by anything correlated with the outcome isn't representative

**Looks like:** measuring some subset of items by sorting on a convenient,
available field (creation order, an id, alphabetical) and taking a fixed
fraction — because the field is deterministic and easy to reason about, not
because it's independent of what you're trying to detect. **Dangerous:** if
the ordering field correlates with the property under measurement, the
sample can be composed entirely of the "easy" or "early" cases while the
metric's own reason for existing — catching the hard, late cases — goes
completely unchecked, and a validation gate built on that sample (a
disagreement threshold, an acceptance test) can pass cleanly while being
blind to exactly the failures it exists to catch. **Avoid:** either measure
the full population when the cost allows it (deletes the whole class of
defect), or stratify explicitly across whatever dimension correlates with
the outcome (here: review round) rather than trusting a single convenient
sort key. A "the sample is deterministic" property is not the same as "the
sample is representative" — the first is about reproducibility, the second
is about coverage, and a fix can satisfy one while still failing the other.
**Overhype:** the loop-ledger's blind-adjudication sample (PR #270) first
sorted findings by GitHub comment id ascending and took the first 30% — but
comment ids track creation order, and propagation/wrong-fix findings (the
metric's actual self-inflicted numerator) can only occur in round 2 onward,
so the sample oversampled round 1's disproportionately-new-ground findings.
The next fix, round-robin sampling across rounds, was still deterministic
and still wrong: its "every round contributes" guarantee was false whenever
a loop had more nonempty rounds than the sample size, and starting the
robin at round 1 meant it systematically dropped the *latest* rounds —
exactly where the numerator lives. Both defects were confirmed by
independent review before the sampling design was replaced entirely with
full-population adjudication. See
[`decisions.md`](./decisions.md#2026-07-27--the-loop-ledger-every-review-loop-gets-a-permanent-falsifiable-row--adjudicated-over-the-full-population-not-a-sample).

## A widening cast over a field the SDK's current version doesn't have

**Looks like:** reading a property off a typed third-party object via a cast —
`(obj as Type & { field?: X }).field` — instead of the field actually being on
`Type`. TypeScript accepts the cast without complaint, because a widening
intersection cast can add any property regardless of whether the base type has
it. **Dangerous:** the code compiles clean, and the field silently reads
`undefined` on every real call — not an error, not a crash, just a `null` where
a real value belonged. Neither typecheck nor an ordinary product-testing pass
catches it: typecheck can't, because the cast is *why* it compiles; testing
often can't either, because the field degrading to `null` doesn't break the
feature it's attached to, it just quietly loses one piece of data forever.
**Avoid:** before reading any field off a pinned SDK's object, grep the SDK's
own `.d.ts` for that field name rather than trusting memory of an older API
version or writing a cast to make TypeScript stop complaining — a cast that
"fixes" a type error on a third-party object is a signal to go verify the
field actually moved, not license to keep going. **Overhype:** `stripe@20`
relocated three fields this same PR needed, each caught only by an independent
reviewer, not by typecheck: `Invoice` has no top-level `subscription` (only
`parent.subscription_details.subscription`); `Charge` has no `invoice` field
at all (use `invoicePayments.list` as the reverse lookup instead); and
`Subscription` has no top-level `current_period_end` (moved to each
`SubscriptionItem`) — the last one shipped as
`(subscription as Stripe.Subscription & { current_period_end?: number }).current_period_end`
and stored `null` on every refreshed entitlement source until PR #287's round
9 review caught it. See
`membership-entitlements.md`.

## A sequence's `last_value` is not a commit-order watermark

**Looks like:** reading a Postgres sequence's current position (`SELECT
last_value FROM some_seq`, or the analogous "current version counter") before
starting some work, then later comparing a row's stamped version against that
watermark to answer "has anything touched this row since I began?" **Dangerous:**
`nextval()` is **not transactional** — a sequence value is consumed the instant
`nextval()` runs, independent of whether the transaction that called it ever
commits, and independent of *when* it commits relative to other transactions.
So a concurrent writer can allocate a token (making it visible to a `last_value`
read) and then commit its write *after* your watermark was taken — its row now
carries a version equal to your watermark, and a `<= watermark` comparison calls
that freshly-committed row stale. Sequence allocation order is simply not the
same thing as commit order, and nothing about `last_value` makes it so.
**Avoid:** compare **committed row values to committed row values** instead of
either side to a sequence position — read each row's own version before the
work begins, then read it again after, and treat "the version changed" as "an
authoritative write landed," whoever performed it. **Overhype:** the
reinstatement fail-closed path (PR #287, review round 8) took
`membership_source_state_seq`'s `last_value` as a watermark before refreshing a
user's sources, then compared each source's `source_state_as_of` against it —
exactly the race above, confirmed independently by review. Replaced with
`loadSourceStateVersions`, which snapshots each source's own version before and
after. See
`membership-entitlements.md`.

## A transaction alone doesn't give two reads one consistent snapshot

**Looks like:** wrapping two related `SELECT`s in `db.transaction(...)` to make
them "atomic," when the actual goal is that both statements see the same
database state — e.g. deriving a status from one query and selecting the row
that status applies to with a second. **Dangerous:** the database's default
isolation level, READ COMMITTED, gives a transaction atomicity **on write**
(all-or-nothing), not a consistent snapshot **on read** — every statement
inside a READ COMMITTED transaction still takes its own fresh snapshot at the
moment it runs. A write landing between the two `SELECT`s (a webhook cancelling
row B, say) is invisible to the first statement and visible to the second, so
the two reads can legitimately disagree about the same row — reintroducing
exactly the inconsistency the transaction looked like it was preventing.
**Avoid:** for a multi-statement read that must see one snapshot, either
collapse it into one statement, or explicitly request `{ isolationLevel:
"repeatable read" }` — safe on a read-only block, since a serialization failure
there has nothing to undo and no write to retry. **Overhype:** twice in one PR
(#287, rounds 8–9): `GET /stripe/subscription` selected a qualifying source in
one statement and the row to return in a second, which could disagree about
which of two subscriptions was current; and the grace-drift admin panel read an
uncapped `count(*)` and a capped sample as two separate statements against a
predicate the hourly sweep was actively changing, which could report a total
smaller than the list beside it. Both were plain `db.transaction(...)` blocks
before the fix — the first was corrected to `repeatable read`, the second to
`count(*) OVER ()` in one statement.

## A guard's population-safety lock protects the count, but not the decision to check it at all

**Looks like:** a mutation reads the target row's current state to DECIDE
whether a lockout/safety guard needs to run at all — then, only if that
decision says yes, opens a transaction, takes the advisory lock, and asks
the guard to count survivors. **Dangerous:** the guard's lock and count are
airtight once invoked, but the READ that decides whether to invoke it at all
happens before the lock exists, so a concurrent mutation can change the
target's state in the window between that read and the eventual write — the
DECISION goes stale even though the COUNT never would have. This is easy to
miss precisely because the guard itself looks correct in isolation (its own
tests pass, its lock/count logic is sound); the bug is entirely in what
happens *before* the guarded transaction, not inside it. **Avoid:** acquire
the same lock the guard uses FIRST, before reading anything the "does this
even need guarding" decision depends on — then make that decision from a
read taken under the lock, inside the same transaction, immediately before
the guard's own count. A helper that only exposes "acquire the lock" (not
just "acquire the lock and count") lets a caller that needs to decide-then-
guard do both under one lock without duplicating the count logic.
**Overhype:** PR #425's admin-lockout guard (`assertAdminPopulationSurvives`,
under `pg_advisory_xact_lock(ADMIN_POPULATION_LOCK_KEY)`) recurred in this
exact shape **twice in the same PR**: round 4 found `PATCH
/admin/users/:id`'s email-change handler reading the target's
email/`isAdmin` via a plain `db.select(...)` before opening any transaction,
so `removesAdminAccess` — whether to call the guard at all — could be
computed from data a concurrent admin-removal was about to invalidate; round
5 found the identical shape in the separate `GET /auth/verify-email`
pending-email-promotion path, which had gotten the crossing-boundary CHECK
right in an earlier round but not the lock-ordering. Both fixed by exporting
`acquireAdminPopulationLock(tx)` (factored out of the guard's own
lock+count) and moving each handler's read + decision inside the
transaction, after acquiring it, before the guard's count. The second
recurrence — same root cause, sibling code path, found one round later — is
also a worked example of the rule that a finding names an instance and the
fix owes the class
([`working-modes.md`](./working-modes.md#a-finding-names-an-instance-the-fix-owes-the-class-david-2026-08-08)):
porting a fix to one of several similarly-shaped call sites and missing a
sibling is common enough to specifically check for once a first instance of
a shape like this is found, not just fixed in place.

## A broad error-class match convicts more than the one case it was written for

**Looks like:** catching an error and testing a general property of it — an
error code, a substring of the message — to answer a specific question ("was
this a duplicate?", "was this a timeout?"), when the general property is shared
by cases the specific question doesn't apply to. **Dangerous:** the broad test
passes on the wrong case just as readily as the right one, and silently
mis-routes it — often into the code path that swallows or acknowledges the
error, which is the most expensive place to be wrong. The bug is invisible in
the common case (where only the intended cause ever produces that error) and
appears only under a specific concurrent or edge condition that produces the
same broad symptom for a different reason. **Avoid:** match the most specific
identifying detail available — a Postgres error's `constraint` name, not just
`code === "23505"`; a specific error subclass, not a message substring — so the
test can only be true for the actual case it exists to handle. **Overhype:** a
webhook handler's catch block tested `code === "23505" || message.includes("unique")`
to detect "this event was already processed," inside a `try` that also covers
domain writes touching *other* unique constraints. Two racing first-purchase
deliveries could violate an unrelated unique-customer constraint during
prepare — a real failure — and the broad test called it a duplicate, silently
acking an event whose purchase was never granted (PR #287, review round 9).
Fixed by matching `err.constraint === "stripe_processed_events_pkey"`
specifically.

## Reading a scoped limit message as a blanket outage

**Symptom:** a tool reports that *one specific capability* is unavailable, and
you conclude the whole tool is down. Work that depended on the still-working
capability silently stops happening — and because you concluded it was
unavailable, you never retry, so nothing surfaces the mistake. The gap looks
like an outage rather than an unasked question.

**Why it happens:** the qualifier is the least load-bearing-looking part of the
sentence. "You have reached your usage limits **for security reviews**" reads
at a glance as "you have reached your usage limits," because the actionable
part (a limit was hit) lands first and the scope arrives as trailing detail.
The failure is reinforced by *consistency*: the message keeps appearing, which
feels like confirmation, when it is only the same scoped condition recurring.

**The nastiest version — and the one that actually happened — is when a written
rule already quotes the qualifier and still draws the unscoped conclusion.**
`pr-watch`'s pre-2026-08-15 rule reproduced the "for security reviews" wording
verbatim and concluded "proceed as if that round's review is unavailable."
Having the evidence in the document did not prevent the error, because the
rule's *conclusion* was what got applied, not its quoted evidence. A wrong
conclusion sitting next to correct evidence is more durable than a plain
mistake: it looks sourced.

**Avoid:** when a tool reports a limit, refusal, or failure, **read which
thing it names** before concluding anything is unavailable — the scope is part
of the message, not colour. Then check the cheap disconfirming evidence: did
the supposedly-unavailable capability produce output anyway, before or after?
On PR #458 a full code review landed six minutes after the "outage," which
would have refuted the reading immediately had anyone looked. And when writing
a rule from an observed failure, make the rule's conclusion quote the same
scope its evidence does.

**Overhype:** the canonical fact and the standing rule live in
[`code-review.md`](../engineering/code-review.md#codex-has-two-usage-limits--a-security-review-bounce-is-not-a-code-review-outage).
Cost: PR #459 sat unreviewed until David corrected the reading, and the
resulting "Codex is unavailable" framing fed into asking him to merge PR #458
while a requested round was still outstanding — 7 findings then landed 47
seconds post-merge, as defects on `main`.

### Sub-pattern: a confident claim about tooling that the tooling doesn't support

The same session produced three of these, which is why it is recorded as a
pattern rather than an anecdote:

| Claim asserted | Reality | How it would have been caught |
|---|---|---|
| No persistable effort setting exists | `effortLevel` is in the settings **schema**; only the docs *page* omits it | Read the schema, not the prose docs |
| The Codex bounce means no review is coming | It means no *security* review | Read the qualifier; check whether a review arrived anyway |
| Self-wakes get counted in the loop ledger | `MECHANICAL_KEYS` has eight GitHub-derived fields and no wake count | `grep` the field list before claiming it |

**The common shape:** each was a claim about what a *tool* can do, asserted
from recollection or from a plausible-but-incomplete source, and each was
cheap to verify — one file read would have settled it. Two of the three were
caught by review rather than by the author.

**Avoid:** before writing down what a tool does or doesn't support, open the
thing that defines it — the schema, the field list, the message text. Treat a
docs page's *silence* as no evidence at all: a curated page will omit a key
but will never invent one, so absence there is not absence.

## Fixing the flagged site and leaving its siblings

**Symptom:** a reviewer names one place a fact is wrong or duplicated. You fix
exactly that place, push, and the next review round names the next copy. Repeat
for as many rounds as the fact has homes. Each round looks like progress and
the finding count never falls.

**Why it happens:** review comments are anchored to a *line*, so they arrive
scoped to one site even when the defect is repo-wide. Fixing what was pointed
at feels complete and is locally verifiable — the flagged line is now correct —
so nothing prompts the wider search. Worse, correcting one copy can *create* a
contradiction, because the other copies now disagree with a document that was
previously consistent with them.

**Avoid:** treat a finding as naming a **fact**, not a line. Before pushing the
fix, grep the whole repo for every other site asserting that fact — including
docs the PR does not otherwise touch — and fix or explicitly qualify each one.
Verify against the *fact*, not the string you happened to delete: a paraphrase
forks exactly as well as a quotation, so a grep for the removed wording can
pass while the claim survives three lines away in different words.

**Overhype:** PR #291 (the async-lane de-fork) narrated six review rounds in
its own body, but the loop ledger's fully-paginated, mechanically-derived
count (row 23 of `.agents/metrics/loop-ledger.md`) is seven — that figure is
the one of record, per this file's own reason to exist, and the "six" here is
superseded by it rather than reconciled against it. This pattern accounted
for a finding in five of the narrated rounds. The clearest instance: a claim
equating async-jobs handler concurrency with database pool occupancy was
corrected in `architecture-map.md` in round 4, which left `background-work.md`
and `deferred-work.md` asserting the disproved version — so the repo
contradicted itself in three places *because* one site had been fixed, and
`decisions.md` turned out to be a fourth. In another instance the round-1 fix
deleted the offending sentences and left paraphrases of the same two facts
inside the very sentence that linked to the spec; the author's own verification
grepped for the deleted strings, passed, and missed it.

**The lexical half of this is now a CI guard** —
`scripts/check-manual-tuning-language.mjs` fails the build on values and their
prose stand-ins in `docs/manual/`, which is what most of those rounds were
actually about. The guard is deliberately narrow and **cannot** detect a fact
with two homes, a paraphrased spec section, or a false claim. Those remain the
human half, and this entry is the reminder that they exist.

**The pattern generalizes past docs to code call sites (PR #308).** Mounting
a new global rate limiter gave several `/api` pollers their first-ever
rate-limit 429 path to handle — **not every poller**, since some endpoints
already had their own pre-existing 429 (see below) — a new failure mode with
**at least four independent call sites** (not a
verified-exhaustive count, per the same undercounting this file's own
"fixing the flagged site" lesson warns about) across two components' worth
of poll loops. The plan's own implementation fixed one (the video/PuLID
pollers) up front; round 1 of review found a second (`AiBgPicker`'s render
poller); round 2 found a third, in an entirely different component
(`SourceImageConfirmModal`) that no earlier fix had touched, plus a fourth
handler (`handleConfirmCancel`) left outside a sibling fix in the *same*
file. Each fix was locally correct and each round looked like progress while
the finding count didn't fall to zero until round 3. **Not every poller of
an endpoint the global limiter now covers was newly exposed** — a Codex
round on this very `/document` harvest found a fifth poller
(`useTaxonomyHealthActions.ts` → `/api/admin/taxonomy-health/job-status` —
the client-visible path; `/admin/...` is only the router-local path before
`app.use("/api", router)` mounts it) whose
429 handling predates this PR entirely, because that route already had its
own `checkSharedRateLimit` call (it's one of the pre-existing DB-backed
limiters `adminTaxonomyHealth.ts` is documented as, elsewhere in this repo's
docs) — a reminder that "every caller of a newly-changed resource" still
needs checking against what was already true, not assumed to be uniformly
new. Same avoidance: when a change introduces a new failure mode on a shared
resource (an endpoint, a response shape, an error code), grep for **every**
caller of that resource before considering the fix complete — not just the
one a review comment or the plan happened to name, and not assuming the
count found is the count that exists.

### Sub-pattern: the sweep itself has three failure modes, learned one per round

PRs #458/#459 ran five review rounds where **every round's finding was
something the previous round's sweep was structurally incapable of catching**.
Each round taught a distinct lesson, and each invalidated the verification
method that had felt sufficient the round before. The parent pattern above
covers only the first.

1. **Sweep by class, not by phrasing.** The first sweep grepped the exact
   strings it had just removed ("switch me to", "Sonnet gate") and passed —
   while `maintenance/SKILL.md` still said *"suggest switching before
   starting."* Same rule, different words. Grep for what the rule **means**,
   with an alternation wide enough to catch paraphrase, and accept noise over
   a false clean.
2. **Re-sweep what the fixes themselves introduce.** The second sweep
   correctly enumerated every home of every rule the PR *set out to change* —
   and missed the Opus-reserved-execution exception entirely, because that
   rule was **created by the previous round's fix**. A sweep anchored to the
   starting set cannot see what the fixes add. Re-run the enumeration over
   the round's own output before calling it done.
3. **The unit is the assertion, not the file.** The third sweep asked, per
   file, *"does this file carry the exception?"* — a boolean that passes the
   moment **one** mention exists. `CLAUDE.md` passed while containing both
   the exception and a contradicting sibling two sections away. Check every
   individual site, and specifically look for **two rules that fire on the
   same condition and disagree** — that shape accounted for three of the last
   four findings.

**A fourth home is easy to forget entirely: the PR body.** It asserts the
rules too, it is what the human actually reads, and no sweep that greps the
working tree will ever touch it. In #459 it still described a superseded
version of the contract — one cap instead of two, a claim the ledger tracked
self-wakes, a rejected case listed as allowed — after five rounds had
corrected all three in the files.

**Avoid:** treat "I swept for it" as a claim needing the same verification as
any other. The honest generalization from these rounds is that self-review
converges on *the method you already had*; an outside reviewer is what
corrects the method. Where no reviewer is available, at minimum re-derive the
sweep from the rule's meaning rather than re-running the grep that already
passed.

### Sub-pattern: the oracle's *scope*, its *invocation*, and the class's *shape*

PR #509 ran five rounds against one class — a claim stated more broadly than
the behaviour supports — and produced **nine confirmed instances across five
files**. Every individual fix was correct. The class kept coming back, and the
reason each time was a different property of the oracle rather than a lapse in
applying it. Three distinct ways, none of which the sub-pattern above covers:

1. **A diff-scoped oracle misses what a correction contradicts, whenever the
   contradicted text predates the branch.** Round 3's sweep ran over the diff
   and passed; round 4's findings were in **unchanged** lines two paragraphs
   below the corrections. **Not an invariant, and the first draft of this
   entry overstated it as one** (Codex, #518): a *cumulative branch* diff does
   contain both assertions when the PR introduced both, so a correction to one
   of them is checkable against the other without leaving the diff. What is
   always outside the diff is pre-existing text — the common case for a
   correction, since correcting something usually means it was already there.
   File scope is the conservative rule because it covers both. The
   reader hitting the section top-down gets the narrowing first and the stale
   claim second, so the later text wins on a skim — leaving a corrected claim
   upstream of an uncorrected one is *worse* than not correcting it, because
   the section now looks reviewed. **Scope the oracle to the file, never the
   diff, whenever the change is a correction.**
2. **The class changed shape and walked past the file-scoped oracle.** The
   round-4 fix widened the scope correctly, and round 5 found an instance
   anyway, because the regex matched **universal quantifiers**
   (`every|all|never`) and the new instance was an **incomplete
   enumeration** — "A or B" where the truth is "A, B, or C". Same class, no
   shared lexical signature. An oracle written from the instances you have
   encodes their surface form; the class is what they mean.
3. **The invocation is part of the oracle, and it took four corrections to
   get right.** PR #430, same day, one line, four successive fixes — each
   correcting the previous symptom and leaving the class intact:

   | invocation | measured failure |
   |---|---|
   | `grep -rn` from the root | **over**-counts — walks `.git`, `node_modules`, generated output |
   | `rg -n` | **under**-counts — skips hidden dirs; a heading that exists only in `.agents/PLANS.md` returns **0 files** under `rg -l` and one under `git grep -l` |
   | `rg -n --hidden` | `.git` is back |
   | `rg -n --hidden --glob '!.git'` | **under**-counts again — ripgrep honours VCS ignore rules, so `rg -l … VITE_MBFO_WIZARD` finds 3 files where `git grep -l` finds 4, missing the tracked `artifacts/overhype-me/.env.local` |

   **The heading is deliberately not quoted here, and that is the sharpest
   instance in this entry.** The first draft named it — at which point this
   file became a second hit, the `rg` probe stopped returning zero, and the
   measured evidence for the claim was falsified *by documenting it* (Codex,
   #518). A probe whose literal appears in its own write-up is not
   reproducible. Cite the shape of the measurement, or pick a string the
   explanation does not repeat.

   The settled answer is **`git grep -n`**, and the reason it settles the
   question is not that it has better defaults — it is that the inventory
   asks *what does this repository contain*, and `git grep` searches the
   **tracked set**, which is that question's definition. Every flag-tuning
   answer was an attempt to make a filesystem walker approximate a corpus it
   has no notion of. **Ask git for the corpus rather than reasoning about
   ignore semantics** — three of the four wrong answers were confidently
   defended before being measured.

**The root generalization, which is about writing rather than tooling:**
summarising a release in prose defaults to naming the two clean cases and
dropping the messy third. Provider-resolved *or* operator-configured — and not
the hard-coded fallback. Every writer records — except the one that reads its
engine before its own `try`. The pull is structural, not careless, which is
why instance-by-instance fixing never generalised across nine attempts.

**A corollary worth knowing at the end of a loop, and it is now universal in
the standard loop** (not the classes and the phase outside it, per
[`working-modes.md`](working-modes.md#the-prototype-phase-per-feature-david-2026-09-26)):
this repo's merge bar needs a completed reviewer pass on the **head** commit,
so any further fix moves the head and costs another pass. That makes "just fix
one more thing" mechanically expensive at loop end — a stopping force
independent of anyone's judgment, worth counting when deciding whether a cheap
fix is actually cheap. **The floor-tier exemption that stood here is gone**
(David, 2026-09-19): transient process docs and ledger records were said to
keep a "zero-re-request rule", so a post-review fix there moved the head
without owing a pass — which is a commit merging unreviewed, the one thing the
write-gate exists to refuse. What bounds those artifacts now is the
**two-review limit** in [`working-modes.md`](working-modes.md#the-two-review-limit-on-autonomous-iteration-david-2026-09-19), which caps how
long iteration runs without ever exempting a changed head from being read. The
worry that made the exemption (Codex, #518) — that stating the corollary
universally leaves an artifact unmergeable in principle — was real under the
old re-request rule and is answered by its replacement: every changed head gets
its review, so nothing is unmergeable for want of one.

**Avoid:** re-running the oracle that just passed and reading a clean result
as convergence. Ask instead which of the three properties changed since it was
written — scope, invocation, or the class's surface form. The instance history
for this one lives in **#516**, which carries the extended oracle rather than
restating it here.

### Sub-pattern: the author of the new rule cannot sweep for the old one

The three sub-patterns above all assume the same reader can derive a better
method next round. AI-Handbook #96 is the case where that failed four times.
Its design change landed in the mechanism; the prose did not follow; and three
successive reconciliations — grep for the retired phrases, then read the
sections end to end by decision path, then both plus an acceptance check — each
missed instances the next review round found. Not one of the misses was
somewhere unexpected. **All three of the last round's were within a screen of
an edit that round's author had just made, and one was a context line inside
the previous sweep's own diff hunk.**

**Why, and it is not carelessness:** the author of the new model reads a stray
clause of the old one as consistent, *because they know what was meant*. The
sentence parses correctly against the intent in their head and never against
the words on the page. That is a property of the reader, not of the method, so
a fourth method run by the same reader has a poor prior whatever its shape —
which is the honest generalisation the #458/#459 entry above already reached
from the other direction ("self-review converges on *the method you already
had*; an outside reviewer is what corrects the method").

**The second half is that a retirement is never one proposition.** #96's was at
least four, and each sweep hunted only the facet the last reviewer had named.
When a cold read was finally run, the readers added two more — one of them
proposed independently by three of the six.

**Avoid:** patching the instances a reviewer named. Sweep instead, by the
method in [`prose-sweep.md`](prose-sweep.md), which is its only statement and
is not restated here.

### Sub-pattern: a deleted thing was a container

Every sweep above hunts **references to** what was removed. None can find what
the removed thing **held** that something surviving still needs, because an
absence has no text to match. The #89 cut (AI-Handbook #102) hit it three times
in two rounds: a skill section deleted as duplicate also held the only
definition of three procedures the always-loaded contract still named; a rule
deleted for its arithmetic had a definition wrapped inside it that a surviving
rule invoked, which deadlocked any PR needing a base-branch merge; and a memory
note's workaround was true only because of the guard being deleted beside it.
Each was found by a reviewer looking at something else.

**Avoid:** when removing a rule, section, or mechanism whole, read the
**removed** text for what nothing else says — a definition stated there, a
numbered rule or heading something surviving points at, a procedure a surviving
document routes to — before the removal merges. The cross-reference half is
mechanical (one grep for the removed rule's number would have caught the
deadlock); definitions and procedures need a reader.

## Satisfying a lexical guard by changing a value's form, not its meaning

**Looks like:** a CI text guard flags a stated value in prose. The fix changes
*how* the value is written — a digit becomes a spelled-out word, a cardinal
becomes an ordinal, a bare value gets wrapped in markdown emphasis or a link,
a phrase gets reflowed across a line break — without changing what the
sentence actually asserts. The guard goes green; the value it exists to keep
out of that document is still fully present, just spelled differently.

**Dangerous:** a green check reads as "compliant," so the sentence doesn't get
looked at again — but the source-of-truth risk the rule exists to prevent (the
same fact living in two places, able to drift independently) is completely
intact. Because each round of this only narrows the *specific* form just
caught, not the general risk, a review loop chasing it can run for many
rounds, one surface form at a time, and look like slow but real progress the
whole way.

**Avoid:** when a value is flagged, ask "does this sentence's truth depend on
the number, in *any* form?" — not "does it still contain the literal string
the rule matched." Removing the concept (say that something exists or is
true, not how much) is the fix; rewording the same count in a different part
of speech is not, and is usually just as fast to write, which is what makes it
tempting. Authoring or extending a guard like this has the mirror-image
discipline: after closing one evasion, actively probe for the *next* form of
the same class (spelled-out numbers, teens, ordinals, hyphenated compounds,
markdown markup, a hard-wrapped line split) instead of declaring the class
closed after the one instance found.

**Overhype:** PR #298 (the manual tuning-language guard) went through six
finding-bearing Codex review rounds, and this exact pattern recurred inside
its own fix history — round 5 found "a simpler 2-lane split ... in favor of
3" and fixed
it by spelling the count out ("a simpler two-way split ... in favor of a
third, separate lane"), which round 6 caught as the same lane count restated
as an ordinal instead of removed; the round-6 fix describes the split
qualitatively with no number in any form, which is what a genuine fix looks
like for this pattern — but that fix was never independently re-reviewed
before merge (see `loop-ledger.md`
row 22), so its correctness is this PR's own claim, not a confirmed close.
Separately, the guard's own detection had to grow across rounds to
cover markdown emphasis/links hiding a value from the regex, a hard-wrapped
phrase split across two physical lines, and a spelled-out-number extension
whose digit-derived "attached s" shorthand accidentally matched an ordinary
English word ("hundred" + "s" = "hundreds," not a duration). The full list of
evasions the guard now covers, and why each was needed, lives in
`scripts/check-manual-tuning-language.mjs`'s own header and rule comments —
not duplicated here.

## Chasing completeness against an adversarial reviewer past the artifact's real risk

**Looks like:** a review loop where every finding is correct, every fix is
sound, and the finding count **stops falling** — often while the artifact grows
and the later fixes start specifying guarantees the platform cannot actually
provide. **Dangerous:** each round is individually justified, so there is no
natural stopping point, and the cost is invisible because the work looks like
diligence. It ends with a large over-specified artifact and real time gone. The
tell is never a single finding — they're usually right — it is the **trend**,
plus the shape of the late-round fixes. **Avoid:** size ceremony to blast radius
at intake, not to how the request was phrased
([`working-modes.md`](./working-modes.md#feature-mode-ceremony-scales-to-blast-radius-not-to-phrasing-david-2026-08-05));
carry pre-registered flip conditions naming an observable read off the round; and
triage every finding into **fix / accept-and-document / escalate** rather than
reading "Required Revision" as automatically meaning fix. **And where a change is
internal by its consequence and recoverability, the sequence is bounded** by
the two-review limit
([`working-modes.md`](./working-modes.md#the-two-review-limit-on-autonomous-iteration-david-2026-09-19)) — this entry's remedies
were ceremony-sizing, an in-round bound and a per-finding test until
2026-09-20, none of which answers "there is no natural stopping point", which
is the entry's own diagnosis. **Overhype:** twice
in one day, 2026-08-05 — PR #329's Bash guard (9 → 11 → 12 → 19 findings, an
unbounded parsing surface; see the sub-pattern below) and PR #333's `/status`
plan (12 → 1 → 4 → 6 → 12 findings, **six review rounds and a 660-line plan for
two markdown skill files**, with round 6 specifying compare-and-swap semantics
GitHub's label API does not offer and acceptance cases with no way to run
them). **The second happened hours after the first was written up**, because
the first was recorded narrowly as a *parser* problem and the lesson did not
transfer — which is exactly why this entry states it at the general level and
demotes the parser case to a sub-pattern.

**A third instance, two days later, on a different kind of unachievable
guarantee (PR #293).** Migration `0097`'s attempt to make the NCMEC
audit-ledger's append-only guarantee a real PostgreSQL privilege boundary ran
17 review rounds and accounted for roughly 65 of the PR's 90-plus findings —
not by finding fewer bugs each round, but by refining the same reachability
model past what the platform can support: `pg_has_role(...,'usage')` →
`'member'` → literal `SET ROLE` success → `ADMIN OPTION` → an *inherited*
admin-option chain → containing-schema ownership → the guard function's own
schema ownership. Each fix was a real, verified correction — and each one
sat on the same unfixable foundation: a migration running as the application
role cannot grant that role a privilege boundary the role cannot already
cross (see the 2026-08-07 `decisions.md` entry). The late-round shape
matches the general pattern exactly — fixes that specify guarantees
(`CREATE ROLE` without conferring membership, a `REVOKE` the current role
cannot execute) the actor available to the migration cannot actually
provide. David cut the scope after the concentration became visible: the
migration now creates the objects and reports the residual state; closing
the boundary moved to a superuser runbook
(`docs/engineering/ncmec-audit-ledger-hardening.md`).
The tell was available well before round 17 — a scope-vs-blast-radius check
at round 5 or so, once "every fix targets the same reachability model,"
would have caught it much earlier than a David-initiated review of the
finding distribution did.

**A fourth instance, the very next day, on an artifact with no blast radius
at all (PR #356, 2026-08-08).** The TEST_RUN checklist for PR #293 — a doc
that is *deleted after one Replit run* — went five review rounds and 36
findings (9 → 6 → 6 → 6 → 9), nearly all against instructions for re-running
test suites that had already passed in CI on the same code. Every finding was
technically correct; every round was a misallocation, because the artifact's
worst case was one confused test run, not a production defect. Each isolation
fix opened the next round's gap (culminating in round 5 discovering the
repo's own test wrappers silently override the variable all the prior fixes
depended on), and the loop only ended when David asked what any of it had to
do with the product — the answer being "nothing," the fix was to **delete the
findings' entire subject from the doc**, not repair it a fifth time. Where
the first three instances were about *unachievable guarantees*, this one is
about **criticality**: the loop's subject was achievable and simply not worth
achieving. That question used to have a formal gate — rate the artifact 1–100 on
"what breaks in production if this is wrong" before requesting round 2, and
single-digit artifacts never loop. **That gate was deleted on 2026-08-20** with
the rest of the self-policed apparatus, at 0-for-15. What asks the question now
is the Worth rule, per finding, before anything is written
([`review-judgment.md`](review-judgment.md)).

**A fifth instance belongs to a different pattern, and is filed separately
(PR #404, 2026-08-11).** The admin-permissions plan loop shares this entry's
surface — correct findings, late-round fixes specifying machinery — but its
root cause is neither an unachievable guarantee nor a criticality mismatch:
the plan's *boundary moved* while it was being reviewed, growing 56% across
three rounds because a totalising Product Intent made every discovery in-scope
by definition. Diagnosing it as this pattern would prescribe the wrong fix
(cut the subject / stop the loop) instead of the right one (split the artifact
and keep going on the smaller half). See
[*A plan that grew during its own review*](#a-plan-that-grew-during-its-own-review).

**A sixth instance, caught earlier than the others (PR #425, 2026-08-13/14).**
The permission-chokepoint CI guards
(`scripts/check-permission-chokepoint.mjs` and its frontend sibling) exist to
catch a hand-written `tier === "legendary"`-shaped comparison outside the
resolver. Across the implementation review loop, four rounds — spread over
a five-round span, round 5 was an unrelated finding — found a genuinely new
gap: round 3 (file-level allowlist scope, fixed),
round 4 (`!==`, fixed), round 6 (a formatter-wrapped multi-line comparison,
fixed), round 7 (a reversed operand, `"legendary" === tier` — confirmed
real, and **declined**, not fixed). Every probe was real and every
finding accurate — this is the identical finding-never-falls shape as the
other five instances, three hardenings deep before the fourth probe is
what finally got a different response. **What's different here is where
the loop stopped.** Rounds 4 and 6 closed gaps in the space of
forms a developer or an agent would actually write by habit — those were
worth fixing. Round 7's reversed operand is a Yoda condition nobody on this
team or Codex writes in this codebase, and the space of
syntactically-valid-but-never-written forms a regex (or even a full AST
parser — it would still miss a new helper function or an `.includes()`
check) could be asked to cover next is unbounded regardless, so "catch
every form" was never a reachable goal for a guard scoped to catch mistakes,
not adversarial evasion. Declined on the merits at round 7, four rounds in —
not round 17 or 20 — because the question this whole entry teaches ("does
this round's fix target the original design or the shape of the previous
round's fix?") was asked directly at the point the answer changed from yes
to no, instead of waiting for a rising-count or growing-artifact tell to
force it. The decision, and the guard's now-explicit tripwire-vs-proof scope
contract written into both scripts' headers so a future round doesn't have
to rediscover the same boundary, is in
[`decisions.md`](./decisions.md#2026-08-14--the-permission-chokepoint-guards-are-scoped-as-a-tripwire-against-habitual-mistakes-not-a-proof-against-adversarial-evasion).

### Sub-pattern: hand-rolled parser chasing full coverage of a real language's syntax

**Looks like:** writing a from-scratch recognizer — tokenizer plus rules —
meant to catch **every** way a general-purpose scripting/shell language can
express a specific dangerous operation ("does this Bash string, however
written, ever run a force push?"). **Dangerous:** each review round finds a
*new class* of bypass instead of a shrinking set, because the target
language's "ways to dispatch a command" surface (wrapper commands, quoting
forms, script-dispatch mechanisms, alias systems) is not practically
enumerable — the same losing shape as blocklist-based XSS sanitization.
Diligence cannot fix a wrong-shaped defense; more review rounds just find
more gaps, and a shrinking-then-growing trend across rounds (see below) is
the tell that the surface isn't converging. **Avoid:** before hand-rolling a
parser for a general-purpose language's command-dispatch semantics, check
whether the operation can instead be made correct **by construction**
(an allowlist/encoder shape instead of a blocklist scanner) or whether a
narrower control that doesn't need to parse intent at all — a server-side
rule, a protocol-level restriction — already covers the actual risk. Size
the defense to the *realistic* threat model (an honest mistake) rather than
a fully adversarial one, when the two genuinely differ, and say so out loud
rather than quietly absorbing round after round. **Overhype:**
.claude/guard.sh / scripts/guard-decision.mjs (both since retired — #94; PR #329) — Codex review
rounds found 11, then 11, then 12, then 19 parser gaps (fixing 9, 11, 11, 0).
The count of newly-found gaps never fell across four rounds, even as each
round's fixes landed. David stopped the loop there
rather than open a round 5: the hook was narrowed to "make the lease
mandatory" and accepted as a best-effort local backstop behind GitHub's
server-side ruleset on `main` (which needs no Bash parsing at all — it
rejects the actual git protocol operation), not chased to full-coverage
completeness. See the
[2026-08-05 `decisions.md` entry](./decisions.md#2026-08-05--the-bash-guard-is-narrowed-to-make-the-lease-mandatory-then-review-loop-iteration-stops-after-round-4-widened-instead-of-narrowed)
and scripts/guard-decision.mjs's own `ROUND 4, AND THE DECISION TO STOP`
docstring section (the file was retired in #94; the reasoning survives here).

## A plan that grew during its own review

**Looks like:** a plan-review loop where the finding counts look *fine* — they
may even be falling — while the plan file itself keeps getting longer. Each
round's fixes are correct. Each fix adds a mechanism (an endpoint, a
reservation system, a lock, a column, a role). The next round then finds
problems in the *previous round's solutions* rather than in the original
design, and the loop silently converts itself from reviewing a document into
writing one. **Dangerous:** the tripwires that existed at the time all read
green. The finding-count rule fired only on a *rise*, and growth routinely happens while
counts fall — so the loop looks like convergence right up until the round
where all the newly-added surface comes due at once.

**The tell is the document, not the findings.** Two questions catch it:
*is the plan longer than when review started?* and *do this round's findings
attach to the original design, or to scope that has been added since?* If most
findings attach to recent additions, the artifact under review is no longer
the artifact that was approved for review.

**Root cause is almost always one document serving as both an end-state vision
and a build plan.** A totalising Product Intent — "any and all X",
"exclusively", "one source of truth" — makes every discovery in-scope *by
definition*: the document has no way to say "true, and next," only "true, so
in." **Avoid:** separate **directions** (end states, reviewed for soundness but not
iterated on the way a plan is — which never meant a corrected direction skips
review of the correction; see `working-modes.md`) from **plans** (one bounded increment, citing its direction), per
[`working-modes.md`](./working-modes.md#directions-and-plans-are-different-artifacts-david-2026-08-11);
apply the increment test *before* writing — which since 2026-09-18 asks what
the increment makes true and what bounds it, rather than reading a verdict off
the vocabulary. Universal wording and independently shippable phases are
reasons to examine the boundary (an ordered migrate/rollout/verify sequence
within one increment is
not this signal); and frame mid-flight scope as **now vs. next**, defaulting
to next.

**Overhype:** PR #404 (workstream #405), 2026-08-10/11 — the admin-permissions
plan ran three rounds at **24 → 14 → 21** findings while growing **877 →
~1,370 lines (+56%)**. The rounds-1-to-2 fall looked like convergence and
concealed the growth entirely; round 3's rise is what finally tripped the
existing stopping rule. Of round 3's 21 findings, roughly 7 attached to the
original core and roughly **14 attached to scope added after review began**
(metered limits, a tester role, engine bands). The diagnostic fact that
separates this from the entries above: across all 59 findings, **not one
overturned a decision from the pre-plan conversation** — the loop was working
correctly on an artifact that contained three projects. The specific miss was
a framing one: when the scope question was put to David, the options offered
were *widen the grid now* or *leave it out*; **now vs. next was never on the
table**, and when a split was finally proposed he took it immediately. The
process changes this produced are #408.

**Not the same as *chasing completeness against an adversarial reviewer***
(above), though they co-occur and PR #404 shows both. That entry is about
loops whose *subject* is wrong — an unachievable guarantee, or an artifact
whose criticality never justified the rounds. This one is about a loop whose
subject is legitimate and whose *boundary* keeps moving. The distinction
decides the fix: the other entry's is to cut the subject or stop the loop;
this one's is to **split the artifact and keep going on the smaller half**.

## Each round finds a defect in the previous round's fix

**Looks like:** a code loop that never converges, where every finding is
correct and every fix is sound, and the thing each new finding is about is the
code the last round added. **Dangerous:** it reads as diligence from inside —
the reviewer keeps finding real bugs, so stopping feels like shipping known
defects — and the cost is invisible because no single round is wrong. Before 2026-09-19 the
loop ended when someone ran out of patience rather than when the code was
right; what ends it now, where a change is internal by its consequence and
recoverability, is the two-review limit
([`working-modes.md`](./working-modes.md#the-two-review-limit-on-autonomous-iteration-david-2026-09-19)), which was built from
this entry's measurement.

**The tell, recognised by hand:** a round has a finding whose lines sit inside
the diff of the last commit pushed for a finding, and so did the round before
it. The unit is the round, never the finding — a single round returning several
such findings is one observation, not several.

**That tell was written up as a mandatory stop rule and the attempt failed.
Read the next section before reaching for it again.**

**Root cause: a fix written to satisfy a finding is local by construction, and
the code this happens in has no edge to be local to.** Guards, parsers,
counters, checks — anything defending an input space that is not enumerable.
Each patch closes the reported case and creates a new boundary; the next round
finds *that* boundary, because it is the newest and least-considered code in
the diff. Two rounds of this is not bad luck, it is the shape.

**Avoid — the response is never a third patch.** This part holds, and it is
guidance rather than a trigger. One of three, in order of preference:
**remove the mechanism** (if what it guards is inconsequential,
[`review-judgment.md`](review-judgment.md) already says delete it);
**derive the value** rather than check it (its *understand the source* step — a
check whose two sides the same code owns guards nothing); or **change the
operation**, which
is the move that actually ends these.

### The stop rule written from this entry did not work (AI-Handbook #91)

AI-Handbook #91 turned the tell above into review-loop rule 7 in
`claude-core.md`: a mandatory stop, keyed to that observable. **David removed
it on 2026-09-15, after seven rounds.** The attempt is recorded here rather
than deleted, because the next person to have this idea should meet the
evidence instead of repeating it.

**Four correct reviewer findings against that one paragraph, in seven rounds**,
each refining a boundary and exposing the next:

1. The trigger fired on line overlap alone, forbidding an ordinary
   second-round fix (round 1).
2. A clause inferred unboundedness from untestability (round 3). **That
   inference is simply wrong, and it is the most reusable thing here:
   testability and unboundedness are different properties.** Correcting a
   sentence of contract prose, or a behaviour only reachable through an
   integration the test environment lacks, has no class-level failing test and
   is perfectly well bounded. Stated unconditionally it condemned every fix in
   the pull request that introduced it. Narrowing it to "mechanisms already
   shown to be unbounded" was rejected too: that turns the trigger back into a
   judgement.
3. The headline counted findings while every other statement of the rule
   counted rounds (round 4).
4. The trigger compared against the **last** fix commit, but a round's fixes
   can span several, so a finding landing in an earlier one recorded nothing
   and the counter could stay at zero forever (round 7).

**And the decisive fact, which no amount of rewording touched: the rule never
once fired on that loop, by its own observable, while that loop exhibited this
exact pattern throughout.** Checked at rounds 4, 5 and 7; negative every time.

**The lesson is not "observables don't work."** AI-Handbook #85's finding
stands — a condition you have to interpret is one you will reinterpret. The
lesson is the question #85 did not ask and #91 paid seven rounds to learn:
**an observable trigger also has to be REACHABLE on a real loop, and nothing
in the process asks that.** A trigger can be perfectly unambiguous, perfectly
read-off-the-record, and still never fire — because the state it names is
narrower than the situation it was written for. Test a proposed trigger
against loops that already happened before making it binding.

**AI-Handbook, four instances inside one workstream (#36), plus the one that
shows the cure.** PR #28: two of round 2's findings were defects round 1's
fixes introduced, and one slipped through a sweep whose exclusion pattern
whitelisted its own target. PR #80: three rounds, each finding a defect on one
failure path, two of them introduced by the previous round's fix. The translation plan
loop: rounds 2 and 3 each found a defect in text the previous round's fix had
added. **PR #83 is the sharpest, and it is also the cure**: the loop-position
round count took *five* attempts — a snapshot glob, a typed count, a named
file, a pass history, and a high-water floor that then trailed by one forever
after the first loss — each a correct fix for the last one's defect. What ended
it was not a sixth patch but the recognition that **counting was the wrong
operation**; recording which passes have ever been seen per commit, and summing,
converged in one round. Overhype PR #329's Bash guard is the same shape without
the cure (9 → 11 → 12 → 19 findings against an unbounded parsing surface), and
PR #293's 17 rounds refining one reachability model is its severe end.

**Not the same as *a plan that grew during its own review*** (above). There the
artifact's boundary moves and the fix is to split it. Here the boundary is
fixed and the *approach* is wrong, so splitting changes nothing — the same
patch-and-repatch runs on each half. **#36's B2 delta review was declined on this entry's strength**
(David, 2026-09-14) — the argument being that a role reading the inter-round
delta detects this only after it has recurred, while an observable read off
the round would catch it the first time, for free. **That argument no longer
stands as stated**: the free catch was rule 7, and rule 7 did not catch
anything. Whether B2 earns building now is open, and belongs to the machinery
audit (#89) rather than to this entry.

## PostgreSQL role/constraint verification traps that look safe and aren't

**Looks like:** code (application, migration, or test) that infers a
PostgreSQL privilege or constraint's real behavior from a surface signal that
seems like it should imply it — a role membership check, a rendered
`pg_get_constraintdef()` string — rather than the thing that actually governs
behavior. **Dangerous:** each trap fails silently in the safe-looking
direction (permission appears absent when it is present, or a constraint
appears correct when it accepts values it shouldn't), so it surfaces as a
production security gap or a migration that "passed" over an unenforced
guarantee, not as a crash. All three below were verified empirically against
this repository's own PostgreSQL 16 target, not taken from documentation —
each contradicted the intuitive reading. **Avoid:** treat every PostgreSQL
privilege/constraint check in migration or authorization code as needing
direct verification against a live instance before trusting it, and prefer
the specific fixes named below over re-deriving them.

- **`pg_has_role(role, target, 'member')` is not "can this role act as
  target."** It is true for a grant with `INHERIT FALSE, SET FALSE` — a
  membership that confers no actual capability. **Use `'usage'`** (ambient,
  inherited privileges) or `'set'` (can `SET ROLE` to it on demand) for a
  narrowly defined, single-grant-shape question — never `'member'` for an
  authorization decision. **Neither `'usage'` nor `'set'` alone answers the
  broader "can this role EFFECTIVELY reach target at all" question** —
  `'usage'` misses a SET-only grant, `'set'` misses an INHERIT-only one, and
  both miss an admin-option chain that lets the role grant itself the
  target on demand. This repo already implements and tests that full union
  (`usage OR set OR a transitive admin-option chain`) in
  `canEffectivelyAssumeRole()` (`lib/db/src/index.ts`) — route an
  effective-reachability decision through that helper rather than a bare
  `pg_has_role` call, or risk reintroducing the exact under-reporting this
  entry's own history is about.
- **`CREATE ROLE x` by a non-superuser `CREATEROLE` role auto-grants `x` to
  the creator, WITH ADMIN OPTION — and the grantor is the bootstrap
  superuser, not the creator.** The creator therefore cannot revoke its own
  new membership: `REVOKE x FROM <creator>` run by a non-superuser who
  isn't the grantor does not raise an error. It emits a `WARNING` and changes nothing — a
  superuser other than the grantor CAN still remove it, bypassing the
  grantor check entirely; only a non-superuser lacking the grantor's
  authority is stuck. Code
  that creates a role and then tries to revoke its own automatic membership
  needs to verify the revoke actually happened (re-read
  `pg_auth_members`), not trust the absence of an exception. There is no
  privileged path around this available to the creator; only the grantor —
  here, a real superuser — or a superuser can remove the row. (PR #293,
  `lib/db/migrations/0097_ncmec_submission.sql`'s original `overhype_audit_maintenance`
  provisioning, later removed entirely — see the 2026-08-07 `decisions.md`
  entry.)
- **`pg_get_constraintdef()` is not a fixed point.** Feeding its own output
  back into `ADD CONSTRAINT` for the identical predicate produces a
  *different* string: `"action" IN (...)` renders as
  `ANY ((ARRAY['x'::varchar, ...])::text[])`, but re-applying that rendered
  text moves the cast onto each array element —
  `ANY (ARRAY[('x'::varchar)::text, ...])`. Any code that round-trips a
  constraint through its rendered text (a migration verifying a constraint
  by comparing `pg_get_constraintdef()` output, `pg_dump`/restore, or
  `drizzle-kit push` reconciling against a Drizzle-rendered snapshot) can
  land in either form for a semantically identical constraint. Worse: no
  amount of pattern-matching on the rendered text can soundly verify a
  CHECK constraint's *meaning* at all — five successive attempts in PR #293
  (a literal string match, matching the mentioned literal set, an anchored
  shape, evaluating the predicate against probe values, then widening the
  anchored shape for both renderings above) were each defeated by a
  predicate that rendered acceptably while enforcing something else, most
  recently one accepting all nine intended literals plus any 13-character
  string via a `CASE WHEN length(action) = 13 ...` disjunct hidden inside
  the array. **The fix that actually converged was to stop verifying and
  rebuild the constraint unconditionally** (`DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS` +
  `ADD CONSTRAINT`) wherever the role has permission, so the post-condition
  holds by construction instead of by inspection — but unconditional
  replacement is only safe when no row can already violate the *new*
  constraint: append-only triggers stop later mutation, not an `INSERT`
  the *currently drifted* CHECK still admits, so a row a prior drifted
  predicate let through would make the replacement `ADD CONSTRAINT` raise
  a violation and roll back the whole migration. Safe here specifically
  because phase 1 has no ledger writers yet (the table is empty at replay
  time) — reusing this "just rebuild it" move against a table that already
  has rows needs a preflight check (or an owner-run repair of nonconforming
  rows) first, not an assumption that unconditional replacement is
  generally replay-safe. See the 2026-08-07 `decisions.md` entry and
  `lib/db/migrations/0097_ncmec_submission.sql`'s action-CHECK block.
- **A hand-authored constraint with no matching declaration in `schema/*.ts`
  is silently removed by the next `drizzle-kit push` — while the migration
  tracker still reports the migration as applied.** `push` reconciles the live
  database against the *TypeScript schema*, not against the migration history,
  so a CHECK that exists only in raw migration SQL reads to `push` as drift to
  be dropped. Nothing surfaces: the journal still lists the migration, a
  re-run of the migration skips it as already-applied, and the constraint is
  simply gone from the database. Found on the live workspace during the PR242
  post-merge checklist, months after 0092 added
  `facts_active_requires_concept` — the *backfilled data* was still correct,
  which is what made it invisible; only the enforcement had disappeared, so the
  next writer to violate it would have succeeded. **Every raw-SQL constraint
  needs a matching `check()` (or index/FK) declaration in the schema file that
  owns the table**, not just the migration — and a repair for a lost one has to
  be a *new forward-only* migration guarded on `pg_constraint`
  (`lib/db/migrations/0098_fact_lifecycle_check_repair.sql`), because re-running
  the original is a no-op the tracker will never perform. Corollary for
  verification: "the migration is recorded as applied" is not evidence the
  constraint exists — query `pg_constraint` directly.
- **Recurred 2026-08-13 with SEQUENCES — the rule covers every object type
  `push` DOES reconcile, not just constraints.** `membership_source_state_seq` and
  `membership_lease_fence_seq` were created by 0095's raw SQL and never
  declared in `schema/membershipEntitlements.ts`, so `push --force` dropped
  both; 16 membership-lease/grace-sweep tests then failed on
  `nextval(...)`. The entry above already stated the general rule, but its
  parenthetical enumerated only `check()`/index/FK — and a sequence isn't any
  of those, which is exactly how a documented pattern recurred in a new
  shape. **Read that list as illustrative rather than exhaustive — but the
  rule is bounded by what `push` actually reconciles**, which is the object
  types drizzle-kit introspects: tables, columns, constraints, indexes, enums,
  and sequences (the last via `pgSequence`). It does **not** extend to
  functions and triggers — drizzle-kit does not model those at all, so `push`
  leaves them untouched and there is no declaration to add. Verified rather
  than assumed: 0095's own `membership_entitlements_guard_immutable` function
  and its trigger are undeclared and have survived many pushes intact, in the
  same migration whose sequences did not. Stating the rule as "anything in raw
  SQL needs a declaration" would send the next author hunting for a
  declaration that cannot exist.
  **What hid it for so long is worth more than the fix:** the drop needs
  *two* pushes to be observable — the first creates from a pristine database,
  the second reconciles against a schema that never mentioned the object.
  GitHub CI builds an ephemeral Postgres and runs push+migrate exactly **once**
  per database, so it never reaches the state that exposes the drop and stays
  green; only a PERSISTENT database (Replit's `heliumdb_test`, a long-lived
  sandbox) gets a second push. **A green CI is therefore not evidence the
  schema is push-safe** — but note that this is a property of how the workflow
  is currently shaped, *not* an inherent limit: pushing a second time within
  one job and asserting the objects survive would reproduce the whole
  transition in CI. That guard is deliberately deferred to its own change
  rather than bundled here (David, 2026-08-13); until it lands, this class is
  caught by nothing but the rule above. Verified empirically before fixing: second push-force
  dropped both sequences, exited 0, and logged nothing. Verification
  corollary matching the one above — query `pg_class WHERE relkind='S'`, and
  when a persistent test database starts failing where CI passes, suspect this
  before suspecting the tests.

## Editing an already-merged migration file — even a comment — makes the hash-tracked runner replay it

**Symptom would have been:** a database that already ran migration N silently
runs it again on the next deploy, re-executing every statement in the file —
including a real `DELETE`, a data overwrite, and a duplicate audit-log
`INSERT` — with no error and no obvious trigger.

**Why it happens:** `lib/db/src/migrate.ts`'s `applyMigrations()` decides
whether a migration is "already applied" by SHA-256 of the migration file's
**entire content** (`crypto.createHash("sha256").update(sql)`, `sql =
fs.readFileSync(path, "utf8")`), not by its tag, filename, or journal index.
Editing *any* byte — including a comment — changes that hash. A database that
already recorded the old hash as applied then sees the new hash as an
unrecognized, pending migration on its next `migrate()` call and runs the
whole file from scratch, `BEGIN…COMMIT` and all.

**Caught during PR #427's review (round 9), not by any automated check.**
Round 8 made a documentation-only fix inside `0099_admin_permissions_core.sql`
— a migration from a *different*, already-merged PR (#425) — to correct a
comment that had become stale. The file happened to be sitting in the diff
because a doc fix elsewhere referenced it; nothing about editing it felt
different from editing any other file. Codex's round-9 review named the exact
mechanism and the exact consequence (the file's own `INSERT INTO
feature_permissions_migration_log` and its conditional `DELETE` are not
idempotent-safe to run twice with intent — a second run inserts a duplicate
audit row and can delete a row a later admin action had deliberately
restored). **Verified, not just restored on the finding's say-so:** the
edited file's SHA-256 matched zero rows in a real database's
`drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` table; the restored, byte-identical file's hash
matched a row already there. Fixed by `git checkout origin/main -- <file>`
(byte-for-byte, diffed empty) and moving the same doc correction into the
adjacent `schema/*.ts` file instead — plain TypeScript, never hash-tracked,
safe to edit freely.

**The rule: a migration file that has already merged into `main` is
byte-for-byte immutable, full stop — not "immutable except for comments" or
"immutable except for whitespace."** There is no safe partial edit, because
the hash function has no concept of "cosmetic." If a migration's comment is
wrong, wrong, or its behavior needs to change, the fix is always a **new**
forward-only migration (or, for pure documentation, editing prose in a
non-migrations file that references it) — never touching the original file's
bytes. This applies regardless of *why* the file is in your diff: it doesn't
matter whether you authored it, whether it's part of the same PR, or whether
the edit is "just a comment" — the moment a migration has a real chance of
having already been applied somewhere (which for anything on `main` is not a
theoretical concern), touching it is a mistake with no small-blast-radius
version.

**A file living in `lib/db/migrations/` is not "docs I can touch" the moment
it sits in your diff.** Before editing anything under that directory, ask
whether it's the migration *this* change is introducing (safe — nothing has
run it yet) or someone else's, already-merged one (never safe). See
[`migrations-and-backfills.md`](../engineering/migrations-and-backfills.md)
for the working rule and
[`.agents/memory/migration-file-immutable-once-merged.md`](../../.agents/memory/migration-file-immutable-once-merged.md)
for the quick-reference version.

## An entitlement gate that reads the tier column when the rule is role-based

**Symptom:** a capability works for everyone it should — except admins, who
are the people least likely to report it, because they assume they have
everything. Nothing errors. The feature simply doesn't happen, and the caller
is told it did.

**Why it happens:** two vocabularies describe the same permission and only one
of them includes admin. `users.membership_tier` is
`unregistered | registered | legendary` and `is_admin` is an orthogonal
boolean, so an admin's *stored tier* is `registered` unless they separately
hold a paid entitlement. The role vocabulary
(`deriveUserRole` → `isAtLeastLegendary`) folds the flag in; a
`hasFeature(membershipTier, …)` lookup cannot, because the feature table is
keyed by tier and no caller ever passes `'admin'` — the `admin` rows seeded in
migrations `0028`/`0029` are unreachable by construction. Because most
legendary gates in the codebase *are* role-based and work fine for admins, the
one that isn't looks correct under exactly the account most likely to test it.

**Avoid — and this is now structural, not advisory.** The whole "decide which
vocabulary a gate speaks" question is gone, because there is only one:
`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/featureAccess.ts`. Route code asks
`can(principal, key)`; the tier-keyed lookup is module-private and
`scripts/check-permission-chokepoint.mjs` fails the build if anything outside
that module references it, reads the grid tables, or adds a new inline role
comparison in a product-feature path. Admin resolution is a union
(`features(tier) ∪ features('admin')`), so the grid's Admin column is what
grants admins a feature — not a hand-written exception beside the lookup.

The old advice ("resolve from the role, optionally OR-ed with the feature
lookup") is what produced the mess: it made the OR a *convention*, and twelve
places ended up gating one capability by two different rules. `facts.ts`'s
captcha bypass was the worked example of the good version and was still wrong —
its comment claimed the direct check was authoritative and the table entry
"secondary", which is two sources of truth stated as a feature.

Sibling gates in the same function remain the tell that something has drifted
back: `createMemeRecord` had `canPulid` on the role and `canPrivate` on the
tier three lines apart.

**And never coerce a denied *privacy* request into its permissive default.**
The gate above was only half the defect. The other half was what it did on
denial: it silently rewrote `isPublic: false` to `true` and returned 201. A
capability quietly not applied is an annoyance; a *privacy* choice quietly not
applied is a disclosure — the caller was told the save succeeded, and the meme
was world-readable at its permalink. Fail closed and say so. An unhonourable
security request is an error, never a downgrade.

**Overhype:** PR #394 restored the builder's Public/Private control, and the
first private meme saved through it was published anyway. The builder maps
`admin → legendary` (`roleToTier`) so the Private pill was selectable and
selected; `createMemeRecord` resolved the entitlement from the tier column,
found `registered`, and coerced the meme public. Both surfaces believed they
were consistent with the other — `VisibilityToggle`'s own comment claimed the
control "can never display a value the server would silently overwrite,"
which was true for every tier except the one the author was testing on.

*Closed structurally, not by fixing the two sites.* `roleToTier` is deleted and
the client is told its entitlements by the server; `VisibilityToggle` takes the
resolved `canSetPrivate` rather than a derived tier, so the control's lock and
the server's gate are one expression evaluated once. A CI guard
(`scripts/check-permission-chokepoint.mjs`) fails the build if the tier-keyed
lookup becomes reachable from route code again.

## Permission-prompt fatigue defeats a "safe" default with no curated allow/deny list

**Looks like:** a genuinely risky tool or environment (one that can push to
`main`, touch a live database, execute arbitrary code) gets its access gated
by ordinary per-action permission prompts — no deny list, just a `default`/
`ask` mode — reasoning that "it'll ask before anything dangerous" is
sufficient. **Dangerous:** it fails exactly when review matters most. A human
facing a *wall* of prompts during real work does not read each one; they
start clicking through, and one-off "allow" clicks silently persist as
standing grants. On 2026-08-11 this produced live, accumulated permission for
an in-Repl agent session to `git commit`, `git push`, `gh auth`, and run
arbitrary `python3 -c` code — the exact review-bypass and code-execution risk
the session's whole operator role existed to prevent — not because anyone
decided to grant it, but because clicking "allow" sixty times is what using
the tool felt like. **Avoid:** for any environment where a mistaken grant has
real blast radius, pair the prompting default with an explicit **deny list**
that takes precedence over `allow` — that's what makes the design
fatigue-proof, since even a reflexive click on a future prompt can't cross a
denied boundary. Then curate a **generous allow list of genuinely low-risk
operations that cannot read arbitrary file content or execute another
command through themselves** (status/log/diff reads, `ls`, `ps`, env
reads) so that prompts become rare enough to actually be read, not merely
fewer — one prompt an hour gets scrutinized, fifty a session get clicked
through. **The allow list itself needs the same scrutiny as the deny
list, not just the presence of one:** a first draft of this exact list
allowed `cat`/`grep`/`find` as "obviously read-only," and a review caught
that each defeats the design in its own way — `cat`/`grep` read file
content through a door (a raw shell command) the `Read`-tool-scoped deny
rules don't cover, and `find -exec` runs an arbitrary command, including
anything else on the deny list, through a prefix the rule never inspects
past. **Overhype:** the local settings override in the Repl (see
[`replit-environment.md`](replit-environment.md#the-repl-requires-a-local-settings-override-that-is-not-in-git),
which also has the corrected list and the full reasoning).

## A derived metric that silently undercounts because its collector only reads one delivery channel

**Symptom:** a number computed from an external source looks authoritative —
counted, not recalled, by a script written specifically so nobody types it from
memory — and is quietly wrong in one direction. Not because the arithmetic is
wrong, but because the *collector* reads one channel and the source emits on
several. The failure is invisible at the point of use: a zero from "nothing
happened" and a zero from "the thing happened somewhere I don't look" are the
same zero.

**The three live instances**, all in the loop-metrics script, all found on
2026-08-15 during and immediately after the first `/maintenance` ledger flush:

| Channel | What the collector reads | What it misses |
|---|---|---|
| Findings | inline **review threads** | a finding delivered in the review **body** — PR #447's round 1 raised a real one (broken TEST_RUN↔UAT sibling links), so the record reads `findings: 0` on a loop that had one |
| Rounds | issue comments and review bodies carrying a `**Reviewed commit:**` marker | a **👍-only clean pass** — the connector's documented behaviour is "if Codex has suggestions, it will comment; otherwise it will react with 👍," and a reaction emits no marker, so PRs #414, #415 and #416 record `rounds: 0`. **Closed 2026-09-03 (#608):** the connector's summary comment carries a Completed Code Review row naming the commit and the moment, and `reviewerPasses` / `pr-ready.mjs` now read it as a pass; a bare 👍 still is not one |
| Rounds | the same marker | a clean pass posted in the **`## Review Result`** comment format, which carries prose, a testing checklist and permalinks but **no marker at all** — unlike the older `Codex Review: Didn't find any major issues. **Reviewed commit:** <sha>` shape, which has one |

**The third one is the most instructive, because it happened *to this entry's
own PR* (#465) minutes after the first two were written.** Codex returned a
full, clean, visibly thorough code review — and it will still record as
`rounds: 0`, because the connector emits at least two clean-pass formats and
only one of them carries the marker. The lesson is not "there are two gaps,"
it is that **the collector keys on a convention the source never promised to
keep**, so the gap list is open-ended and will grow again whenever the
connector changes its output shape.

**Why it bites harder than an ordinary bug:** the undercount is *credible*.
the loop-metrics script exists because recalled figures in this repo were wrong
three times out of three, so a counted figure carries earned authority — and
that authority transfers to the gaps. On the 2026-08-15 pass the `rounds: 0`
on #414/#415/#416 was read as "these PRs were never reviewed," reported to
David as a process failure, and nearly written into three records as a
finding. The truth was the opposite: all three were reviewed and came back
clean. **Each record's own original note had said so correctly**; the sweep
that re-derived them replaced a right answer with a wrong one, because the
sweep trusted the number over the prose.

**A second shape of the same failure: the numbers are counted and the
sentences around them are not.** On 2026-08-18 I generated what I called a
mechanical record for PR #503's review loop, correctly counted its rounds and
findings from API data — and then narrated the *budget state* from inference,
reporting a growth tripwire as never classified and the loop as having
overrun its budget by two rounds. Both were false and both were checkable: the
round-4 review request had classified the growth contemporaneously, and rounds
4 and 5 had been released by the mechanism's own tripwire-1 adjudication and a
tier-2 authorization. The counted half was right; the narrated half was
recalled, and it was the half that carried the conclusion. **A record is only
as mechanical as its least mechanical sentence** — and the counted figures
lend their authority to the prose sitting beside them, which is exactly what
makes the mixture more dangerous than an openly recalled account.

**Its remedy is different from the collector fix below, and reaching for that
one would be wrong** (Codex, #518): no channel is missing and no count is off,
so teaching the collector about another delivery channel changes nothing. What
this case needs is **provenance on the prose** — every process-state sentence
in a record either cites the artifact it was read from (the review request,
the receipt, the comment) or is cut. The check is mechanical even though the
sentence is not: *which file did I open to write this?* If the answer is "I
remembered", it does not belong in a record calling itself mechanical.

**Avoid:** before reading a zero as an absence, ask *which channel would this
have arrived on, and does the collector read it?* Check the cheap
disconfirming signal — for a review, that is the PR's reactions and its review
bodies, neither of which the marker scan touches. And when a record's prose
disagrees with its own derived number, **that is a signal to investigate, not
prose to correct**: the human note was written with context the collector
never had.

**Do not hand-fix the numbers.** The never-type-mechanical-values rule still
governs — a hand-edited count is exactly the failure the loop-metrics script was
built to prevent, and a corrected-by-hand record is indistinguishable from a
fabricated one. Record the gap in the affected record's `notes` and leave the
derived value alone, which is what #414, #415, #416 and #447 now do.

**The real fix, if this recurs:** teach the collector the missing channels —
reactions for the clean-pass case, and a body-level finding count for the
other — rather than documenting around them a third time. Per this repo's
standing rule, a pattern that recurs graduates from a memory note to a
deterministic check.

**Overhype:** historical — the loop-record store, its contract, and the
per-agent ledger obligation were all deleted 2026-08-20 (issue #541); the
entry above remains as the record of the pattern, not a live pointer.

## A gate's precondition is treated as optional, so the gate silently doesn't run

**Looks like:** a check that fails closed correctly — it denies on its own
internal error, it distinguishes "you are over the limit" from "I could not
tell" — but whose *input* is resolved beforehand by something that can fail,
and whose call site expresses "we could not get the input" as **"there is
nothing to check"** rather than **"check anyway, conservatively"** or
**"deny."** The gate's own hardening reads as complete because every branch
*inside* it is correct; the hole is in front of it.

**Dangerous:** the skip fires exactly when something else is already broken,
so the protection disappears at the moment it is most needed, and typically
with only a WARN log to say so. It also survives review well, because the
conditional looks like ordinary defensive coding (`if (priced) { …gate… }`)
and reads as *more* careful, not less.

**Avoid:** treat resolving the gate's input as part of the gate. On failure,
either degrade to a conservative estimate and still run the check, or deny —
never skip. When choosing between those two, ask whether a *defensible*
substitute value exists: a model-specific configured estimate is defensible;
a number derived from a source you could not read is not, because nothing
proves it doesn't undercut what that source actually said.

**The precondition can also be ORDERING, not just availability.** A callee
that resolves a cheap exemption *before* its own fallible work is defeated by
a caller that resolves that fallible work in the argument list — arguments are
evaluated before the callee is entered, so `gate(user, await expensive())`
puts `expensive()`'s failure in front of an exemption the user was entitled
to. The fix belongs in the callee (accept a thunk, invoke it after the
exemption), not in the caller re-deriving the exemption — a caller that
re-derives an authorization decision to fix an ordering bug trades a
correctness bug for a source-of-truth-drift bug.

**Overhype:** the generation spend gate. `checkBudget` was hardened to fail
closed on its own errors (#409, PR #443), but three of four call sites wrapped
it in `if (priced)`, so a fal pricing miss — no cached row, pricing API down,
no FAL key — skipped the spend check entirely and left the per-user ceiling
unenforced (PR #474). `videoPipelineRunner.ts` had always had the right shape:
`estimateStage2Cost` degrades to the engine's configured estimate and still
calls the gate. The ordering variant appeared *inside the fix for that*:
resolving the fallback eagerly in `checkBudget`'s argument list put a fallible
`engines` read ahead of the admin exemption, refusing admins a check they are
exempt from. `scripts/check-budget-gate-unconditional.mjs` is the CI backstop;
see also `security-model.md`'s generation-spend section.

## A boot-time check written as a statement runs after every import, not before

**Looks like:** adding a configuration assertion — "refuse to start without
this secret / this env var / this credential" — as a call near the top of the
entrypoint, right beside the other early checks, and treating "it's the first
thing in the file" as "it's the first thing that runs." **Dangerous:** ES
module imports are *all* evaluated before the importing module's first
statement executes, so the assertion runs after every module the entrypoint
imports has finished its own top-level work. If any of them opens a database
pool, reads a file, or starts a worker at module scope, the process has
already done the thing the assertion was supposed to prevent. The check still
throws, so it looks like it works — it just throws too late, and every unit
test of the assertion function passes regardless because none of them involve
the entrypoint.

**Bundling makes it worse in a way that is invisible in source.** A module
whose bottom carries the standard `if (process.argv[1] ===
fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))` CLI guard is inert when imported as a
library — but esbuild folds it into the output bundle, where both sides of
that comparison resolve to the *bundle's* path. The guard becomes true, and
whatever it was guarding (a CLI's pool, its migrations, its `process.exit`)
now runs during module evaluation of the production server.

**Avoid:** if a check must precede the module graph, it has to *be* a module
in that graph, imported for its side effect ahead of everything else — not a
statement in the file that imports them (this repo's is
`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/bootChecks.ts`). Keep that module's own imports
minimal for the same reason; anything it reaches is pulled forward with it.
Then verify against the **built artifact**, not the source: run the bundle in
the failing configuration and confirm the error you expect is the error you
get.

**The verification trap this hides behind is checking the wrong quantity.**
It is possible to check the bundle carefully, find the assertion positioned
ahead of every database call, and conclude the ordering holds — because
*statement order* was preserved and that is what got measured. Statement order
was never the binding constraint; module evaluation order was. This is the
same shape as the assert-from-the-artifact pattern above, one level up: a real
check, correctly executed, reported as verifying something it does not
address. The tell is that the check and the claim use different nouns.

**Overhype:** the `IP_HASH_SALT` production assertion (PR #484). First version
called `assertIpSaltConfigured()` at the top of `index.ts`; because
`transientRenderLog.ts` imports `@workspace/db`, and `lib/db/src/migrate.ts`'s
CLI guard is true inside `dist/index.mjs`, a production boot with no salt and
an unreachable database exited on `ECONNREFUSED` from `migrate.ts` and never
emitted the salt error at all. Fixed by moving the assertion into
`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/bootChecks.ts` (imported second, after
`./instrument` only) and splitting the salt logic into
`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/ipSalt.ts`, which never reaches the database. The
folded-CLI-guard half is a live pre-existing bug in its own right —
production runs migrations twice at every boot — tracked separately as #486.

## A guard that encodes the shape that occurred, and calls it a class

**The pattern.** A regression happens. You write a CI guard so it cannot happen
again, and the guard's own header claims it makes a *class* of defect
impossible. But what you actually encoded is the one **spelling** the defect
wore when you met it. The next instance wears a different spelling, walks
straight past, and the guard reports green — which is worse than no guard,
because the green is now load-bearing in everyone's reasoning.

**The worked example.** `scripts/check-record-cost-unconditional.mjs` was
written after measuring that restoring the old `if (cachedPriceForRecording)`
wrapper produced **zero typecheck errors and a fully green test suite** — a
genuinely good reason for a source guard. Its first draft then walked
`IfStatement` nodes and matched a hardcoded list of six variable names. Codex
probed it with three shapes and all three exited 0:

- `priced && await recordCost(...)` — short-circuit, not an `IfStatement`.
- `priced ? recordCost(...) : undefined` — ternary, not an `IfStatement`.
- `if (estimatedCostUsd > 0) { recordCost(...) }` — an `IfStatement`, but that
  identifier was absent from the name list. **This one was not hypothetical: it
  is a wrapper the very same PR had just removed.**

**Two failure modes, and they compound.** *Syntactic narrowness* — checking one
AST node kind when the invariant is about control flow, which has several
spellings. And *enumerating instead of ruling* — a list of yesterday's variable
names protects against yesterday's regression only. The fix for the second was
to encode the naming **rule** (`/pric|cost/i`) rather than the names.

**What to do instead.**

1. **State the invariant before the implementation**, in one sentence, and
   check the code against the sentence. Here it was *"every branch records"* —
   which immediately makes the ternary and short-circuit cases obviously in
   scope, and which also revealed the guard must NOT simply copy its sibling
   (the gate guard's rule is "never inside a price conditional", and a price
   conditional is the *correct* shape for recording, since the branches record
   different provenance).
2. **Probe it, both directions.** Write the bad shapes and confirm each is
   flagged; write the correct shapes and confirm none is. Widening a matcher
   makes false positives reachable — here, `if (priced) { record; return; }`
   followed by a fall-through record is correct and had to be exempted.
3. **Write the residual limits into the header**, so a pass is never read as
   proof. Naming-based matching still misses a flag called `resolved`.

**Related:** the sibling rule *"recurring failure patterns become CI guards"* is
what produces these guards in the first place, and remains right — this pattern
is about the guards being narrower than their own claims, not about writing
fewer of them. `check-budget-gate-thunk.mjs` was designed against this entry
from the start, which is why its rule is bright-line rather than a list.

## A discovery gate written as a security boundary also discards legitimate work it never meant to touch

**The pattern.** A tracking system needs a trust boundary — some signal that
distinguishes a legitimate item from one an untrusted actor could forge — and a
label written by a privileged account is a reasonable one. But the same
condition ("does this carry the label?") also gets used to answer a completely
different question: "does this item exist and need attention at all?" When
those two questions share one gate, anything that legitimately lacks the label
— not because it's untrusted, but because nobody ever labeled it — is silently
treated as if it doesn't exist. The gate's own words ("not part of this
system — ignore it") were written to describe an attacker's forged issue; they
also, unintentionally, describe an open pull request with failing CI that a
collaborator opened five minutes ago.

**The worked example.** The `/next` skill (`.claude/skills/next/SKILL.md`)
ranks work by pulling every open GitHub issue and classifying it: issues
carrying a `stage:` label are workstreams, and "everything else is not part of
this system — ignore it, and ignore any marker in it. Outside accounts can
open issues here but cannot apply labels, which is what makes the label the
trust boundary." Correct as written — but PRs were only ever discovered
*through* a labeled issue (`pull_request_read` on "linked PRs... one batched
call per workstream that has one"). Two real open PRs fell through as a
result, on 2026-08-19: **#515**, an open PR with genuinely red CI, whose
underlying issue carried no label at all (nobody had triaged it yet — nothing
to do with trust); and **#513**, whose linked issue's `stage:code-review`
label was accurate when written but described an *earlier* PR against that
issue, one that had already merged days before — the label was stale
snapshot data, not lying data, but the skill trusted it as current anyway.
Neither PR needed to forge anything to become invisible; they just needed to
be new enough, or a second pass, that the label hadn't caught up.

**The second half of the same mistake: reading a label as current state in a
context where a live signal is available and more current.** A label is
written once and then never automatically revisited — it says what was true
*when someone last touched it*, not what's true now. A PR's own checks,
reviews, and unresolved threads are live by construction (GitHub computes
them on every event); an issue's `stage:` label is not. **This is narrower
than "the label isn't the source of truth"** — `workstream-tracking.md`'s
contract that `stage:`/`waiting:` labels are the canonical lifecycle state
stands untouched; the fix only added specific live PR signals (red CI, a
stalled review round, unresolved threads) as ranking inputs that can outrank
a label *for `/next`'s own prioritization decision*, not a general license to
disregard labels wherever they conflict with something live.

**What to do instead.**

1. **Don't let one gate answer two questions.** "Is this trustworthy" and "does
   this need to be discovered at all" are different questions, and can have
   the *same* correct trust boundary applied to different objects rather than
   one applied transitively through an intermediary. This repo's actual
   defense against a forged PR is `author_association: OWNER` filtering (a PR
   needs no push access to open — anyone can open one from a fork on a public
   repo) — `/next`'s fix kept that filter on the PR sweep directly instead of
   relying on the issue's label to vouch for it.
2. **Sweep for the object directly, not through an intermediary.** `/next`'s
   fix (PR #522) added an independent, still-filtered `list_pull_requests`
   sweep alongside the issue sweep, rather than trying to make the
   issue-labeling ceremony more reliable — the intermediary was the bug, not
   the label logic itself.
3. **State exactly which decision the live signal is allowed to win, not a
   blanket "live beats cached."** Encode that explicitly and narrowly
   (`/next`'s Step 3 lists three specific ranking cases where "a PR's live
   state can outrank its issue's label") rather than a general rule that
   would silently license ignoring a valid label anywhere else it's used.

**Related:** this is a different failure from *"duplicate source of truth"*
above — there's still one canonical lifecycle source of truth (the label,
per `workstream-tracking.md`), and the fix didn't relocate that; it added a
narrow, explicitly-scoped override for one consumer's ranking decision, on
the object (the PR) whose live state that consumer actually needed.
**Not yet audited**: the sibling skills `/status` and `/status-all` derive
their state from the same stored `stage:`/`waiting:` label pattern and have
not been checked for the same discovery gap (tracked in #523).

## An unrelated content change trips a heavy, timing-sensitive test suite because CI classifies by path, not by risk

**The pattern.** CI classifies which test jobs to run by which **paths**
changed, as a speed optimization — a docs-only diff shouldn't have to wait on
the full integration suite. But "touches this path" and "is low-risk" aren't
the same predicate, and when one file under a classified path is generated
from another file that isn't, editing the *source* silently pulls in the
*generated* path's full weight. A change that looks docs-only from the diff's
subject matter runs exactly as heavy a suite as a real code change would —
including whatever flakiness lives in that suite, on infrastructure never
sized for a docs PR's traffic.

**The worked example.** Editing the Overhype.me Manual (`docs/manual/`)
regenerates its rendered help content into `artifacts/`, which is a path the
CI classifier treats as code — so a pure documentation PR runs the **full
heavy integration suite**, sharing one Postgres container across four test
shards. That suite had a timing-sensitive test
(`cliJobPoller.test.ts`, see [`TESTING.md`](../tests/TESTING.md)'s
*Regression fixtures* section for the mutation-testing verification technique
the fix used)
with only 15ms of real headroom against CI-load jitter. The failure rate
escalated over one evening (2026-08-17→18) — intermittent on one PR, then
failing **both** runs on a docs harvest PR that only edited prose — to the
point where **every manual-touching docs PR became unmergeable**, entirely
because of a test file whose subject matter (an async job poller) has nothing
to do with documentation. PR #515 fixed the timing margin; the coupling that
let a docs edit trip it is the generalizable part.

**What to do instead.**

1. **When a path-based CI classifier exists, know what's actually reachable
   through each classified path** — not just what's nominally *in* it.
   `artifacts/` is "code" to the classifier because most of what lives there
   is code; a generated-content subtree changes that for anyone editing its
   source.
2. **A test suite that's expensive or flaky enough to gate on path deserves
   to be reliable regardless of who trips it.** The fix here was correctly
   scoped to the test's own margins, not to carving out a documentation
   exception in the classifier — a real regression in the poller should still
   fail a docs PR that happens to regenerate its way into that suite; the
   problem was the test's reliability, not that it ran.
3. **A recurring "this PR shouldn't be blocked by that" complaint is a signal
   to trace the actual dependency**, not to special-case the symptom. The
   generalized fix here was narrower than either "exempt docs paths" or
   "always run everything" — it was "make the suite that's already running
   correctly reliable."

## A `/document` harvest drafted immediately after its triggering PR ships claims it hasn't actually verified

**The pattern.** A `/document` harvest is written right after the PR it's
harvesting merges — same session, same context, no cooling-off period. In
three observed instances (below), that immediacy co-occurred with a claim
that sounded authoritative but hadn't actually been checked against
anything. **Whether the immediacy caused that, versus merely being present
when it happened, is not established by these three instances** — a point
raised twice already in this entry's own review (rounds 1 and 2) and worth
holding onto rather than letting causal language creep back in through the
framing, which is exactly what happened once already before this fix. This
is also **not one narrow failure shape** — an earlier draft of this entry
claimed it was ("evidence generalized past its scope"), which was itself an
instance of the same thing: force-fitting genuinely different failures into
one tidy mechanism because a single shape makes a cleaner paragraph.

**The worked examples — three independent instances in one session
(2026-08-18/19), each caught by Codex, none caught by the harvest's own
author before review, and genuinely NOT all the same shape:**

| Harvest PR | What went wrong | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #525 (harvesting #522) | Named "opening a PR needs push access" as the trust boundary for an independent PR-discovery sweep — flatly false on a public repo, where any account can open a PR from a fork. The actual boundary (`author_association: OWNER` filtering) was already correctly *implemented* in the code being documented; the harvest just asserted a mechanism that doesn't exist. | **Unverified factual claim** — asserted without checking whether it was true. |
| #513 (harvesting #504), finding 1 | A rule stated as applying to "any number" that needed a carve-out for canonical/configured values it hadn't considered. | **Unscoped generalization** — a real distinction, stated more broadly than it holds. |
| #513, finding 2 | An unconditional step that needed a conditional carve-out a sibling item in the same list already implied. | **Internal inconsistency** — contradicted its own neighboring text. |
| #513, finding 3 | Credited a single condition with ending a five-round cycle when the source material it was citing named two. | **Dropped evidence** — omitted half of what its own citation said. |
| #513, finding 4 | Invented a specific "three failed attempts" threshold with no evidence anywhere behind that number. | **Fabricated specificity** — not a generalization of a real result; a number that was never measured. |
| #513, finding 5 | Treated a deferred CI guard as adequately tracked by review-guidance prose instead of routing it through the repo's actual backlog mechanism. | **Procedural miscategorization** — right observation, wrong home. |
| #528 (harvesting #515) | Described a mutation-testing technique as distinguishing "correct and reliable" from "too loose" — when killing one deliberately-introduced mutant only establishes that the test still detects *that specific* fault. | **Unscoped generalization** — the one genuinely clean instance of "a real local result restated more broadly than it supports." |

**Why this is still one pattern despite the varied failure kinds — and what's
NOT established.** Not because the failures share a mechanism — they don't,
and claiming they did is the mistake this entry itself made and had to
correct (round 1 of this entry's own review). Nor because immediate,
no-cooling-off drafting is a demonstrated *cause* — a second overclaim, also
corrected (round 2), and the correction needed a third pass (round 3) to
fully hold, since causal-sounding language survived in the opening after
the explicit denial was added here. **What actually generalizes across all
seven instances is narrower: none of the six failure kinds above was asked
about by the `/document` harvest's own pre-review Step 4 self-check, before
the harvest was ever opened for review — the PR review that actually caught
every one of these seven findings is not the gap; the author-side check that
runs before a harvest ships is. That's a real, specific gap, not "no
verification happened."**
`documentation-workflow.md`'s Step 4 already catches duplicate homes,
manual/ai-context contradictions, and invented **product** truth (an
unverified product claim must carry *Needs David confirmation*) — that part
of the cross-check is real and these seven instances aren't counterexamples
to it, since none of them were claims about product behavior. What Step 4
didn't ask about is a different category: claims about this repo's own
tooling, process, and citations — is a stated mechanism actually
implemented the way described, does a scope claim match what was
demonstrated, does neighboring prose agree with itself, does a citation
represent its full source, was a number actually counted, is a tracking
item routed to the doc that owns that kind of tracking.

**What to do instead.** Don't reach for a single unifying mechanism, cause,
or "the gap is total" framing to explain a cluster of review findings
unless the findings actually establish it — check each claim, including
claims made *about* the findings, against what verifying it would actually
take. That applies to this entry's own three rounds of correction as much
as to the harvests it describes. The actual per-claim check for the
non-product-truth gap lives in
[`documentation-workflow.md`](./documentation-workflow.md)'s Step 4 — one
question per failure kind in the table above, kept there rather than
duplicated here so there's exactly one place to update when a question
changes.

## A persistent counter of state the source of truth already holds

**Looks like:** you need to know how many times something has happened, so you
write it down — a tally file, a counter column, a receipt that accumulates
entries. It is committed, validated, guarded. Then the bugs start, and every
one of them is about the *record* rather than about the thing being counted: it
double-counted because two writers appended; it went stale because the process
died before committing; it recorded an event that then didn't happen; it needs
a repair command; the repair command needs its own validation; the durability
check needs a test.

**The tell — and it is the reliable one:** *each fix defends the previous fix
rather than the original concern.* A review round where most findings land on
the repair machinery instead of the design is not a sign the design is nearly
hardened; it is a sign the design is a **cache of state the source of truth
already holds**, and every failure is therefore a cache-coherence failure.
Cache coherence has no local fix, so the fixes cannot converge — there is
always one more window between the two copies.

**The worked example.** The review-round budget guard (PR #503) first counted
rounds with a committed tally that the hook appended to on each allowed
`@codex review` post. In one evening it produced: a double-count (two writers —
a hand-written entry plus the guard's own), a phantom round (a request that
posted and yielded no review, so the tally was ahead of truth), a `reconcile`
subcommand to repair the phantom, a durability rule requiring the tally be
committed before the next round, and a stale-SHA wart in every review request
as a side effect of that commit. Round 3 returned 12 findings, **6 of them
against that repair machinery rather than the design.** Reassessing found one
bug twelve times. GitHub already holds the authoritative record of how many
reviewer passes a PR has had; the tally was a second copy of it.

**The fix is deletion, not another layer.** The tally, `reconcile`, the
durability check, and the commit-before-next-round rule were all removed in one
commit (`0cd6f3c`). Rounds were then counted fresh from a validated GitHub
snapshot at the moment of the decision, using the same `reviewerPasses()`
function the loop ledger used — both of which went in the #89 cut
(2026-09-16), so what stands here is the pattern, not a live pointer. Five of
round 3's findings dissolved with the code they were about; nothing was left
to keep coherent. A stalled round and
its retry are now one round automatically, and the count self-corrects when the
retry's pass lands — because nothing was written down to be wrong.

**Avoid:**

1. **Before persisting a count, ask who else already knows it.** If an external
   system is authoritative for the event you are counting, you are writing a
   cache. Read it at decision time instead, and validate the read hard.
2. **Persist decisions, not evidence.** PR #503 kept the *budget declaration*
   and the *extension grants* committed — those were choices nobody else held a
   copy of, and which David gates had been passed, and what he granted at each,
   had to survive the container or the second tripwire never fired. It stopped
   committing the round count, which was evidence. **Budgets, grants and
   tripwires all went with the #89 cut**; the principle is what survives, and it
   is about any decision, not about that machinery. The line between
   the two is the whole rule: evidence is session-local and re-derivable; a
   decision is not.
3. **Treat "most of this round's findings are about the last round's fixes" as
   a design signal, not a diligence signal.** The self-policed oscillation
   rule this used to cite was retired in 2026-08-20 at 0-for-15, and the external
   adjudicator that replaced it went with the #89 cut. What carries the signal
   now is the shared judgement — two assessments that read the round
   independently and advise — asking the sharper question the self-policed rule
   never could: whether writing more code for these findings is worth it at
   all. **And where a change is internal by its consequence and
   recoverability, the sequence itself is bounded** by the two-review limit ([`working-modes.md`](./working-modes.md#the-two-review-limit-on-autonomous-iteration-david-2026-09-19)),
   which is what actually stops the pattern this item describes; the shared
   judgement answers what is written *for*, one finding at a time. This item's
   two sibling entries were given that pairing on 2026-09-20 and this one was
   not.

**Related:** *A derived metric that silently undercounts because its collector
only reads one delivery channel* above is the opposite failure — there the
counting is live and the *collector* is incomplete. Deleting a cache does not
protect you from that one; both apply to the same code.

## A "durable" or "committed" check that proves a proxy, not the property

**Looks like:** a guard needs to establish some property — that a file is
committed, that a config is deployed, that a value was reviewed — and checks
the nearest cheap thing that is usually true when the property holds. The
check goes green in every test, passes review, and is satisfied *forever* by a
one-time event, because the proxy is not the property.

**The worked example, which caught its own author.** PR #503's guard must
refuse an extension receipt that exists only in the working tree: a grant that
dies with the container would let the next session be offered the same
one-time tripwire again. The first fix asked whether the receipt's **path**
existed in the upstream ref. A committed receipt satisfies that permanently —
so editing a committed receipt in the working tree took effect immediately,
and a grant could be raised locally with nothing durable saying so. It was
found by exactly that: recording David's second authorization required raising
a grant from 1 to 2, and the freshly-written durability check waved the edit
through. `a19dc6a` compares the bytes instead, which makes "durable" mean the
thing that is actually granting the rounds.

**Why it survives review.** The proxy check and the real check are the same
sentence in English — "the receipt is committed" — and differ only in what
would falsify them. Reviewers read the sentence. The test suite tests the
sentence. The gap appears only when someone changes the contents without
changing the path, which is not the shape anyone was imagining while writing
it.

**Avoid:** name the property in terms of what would *break* if it were false,
then check that. Here: "the grant that is being honoured is the grant that is
durable" — which forces a comparison of the granting bytes, not a lookup of a
filename. When a check's subject is a file, ask whether you care about its
existence or its contents; a check about authority almost always means
contents.

**Update (PR #531): the byte-comparison fix above was itself still a proxy.**
Comparing bytes fixed *this* falsification but not the shape that produced it:
the check still worked by reading the working tree and then reconciling it
against git, which is the identical cache-coherence structure as *A persistent
counter of state the source of truth already holds* above, one layer down —
"the working tree" being a cache of "the commit." The fix was the same fix:
deletion. `readDurableJson`/`listDurable` were changed to read the budget and
extensions **only** from `git show`/`git ls-tree` against the branch's
remote-tracking ref — all of it since removed in the #89 cut (2026-09-16), so
the lesson is what stands here, not the code; there was no working-tree read
to reconcile because there was no second copy. Pinned by a test that disables
both filesystem readers entirely and
asserts the loop still loads. Same lesson, restated because it recurred one
layer inward: a "durable" check built on comparing a local copy to the source
of truth should usually just read the source of truth.

**Related:** *Satisfying a lexical guard by changing a value's form, not its
meaning* above is the mirror image — there the guard's subject is right and its
matcher is evadable; here the matcher works perfectly on the wrong subject. *A
predicate inferring an external property from local configuration accumulates
exception clauses without bound* below is what happened next, when the deleted
check's replacement (the git ref itself) turned out to have the same shape of
problem one layer further out.

## A predicate inferring an external property from local configuration accumulates exception clauses without bound

**Looks like:** a check needs to know something true about the outside world —
will this survive past the session, is this remote real, is this value what it
claims to be — and answers it by reading local configuration that *usually*
correlates with the real answer. The first version works. Review finds a
counterexample; you add a clause. Review finds another; you add another
clause. Each fix is locally correct and the check gets no closer to done,
because the surface it is enumerating over is open: configuration is a
*description*, and a description can diverge from reality in as many ways as
there are ways to write it.

**The tell:** more than one independent counterexample to the *same* predicate
lands in a single review round. One counterexample is a bug. Three in one
round, each defeating the predicate a different way, is the surface telling
you it has no boundary.

**The worked example.** PR #531 deleted a cache-coherence check (see *A
"durable" or "committed" check that proves a proxy, not the property* above)
and replaced it with `durableRef()`: infer whether a git ref will outlive this
container by inspecting the branch's local upstream configuration.
Round 1 found a local branch could masquerade as a remote-tracking one
(`refs/remotes/` vs `refs/heads/`, indistinguishable once abbreviated) — fixed
by checking the full ref. Round 2 found a remote's fetch URL could point
locally while the ref still lived in `refs/remotes/` — fixed by resolving the
URL. **Round 3 found three more, independently, in one pass:** a remote with a
network fetch URL but a local `pushurl` (only the fetch URL was checked); a
local-path remote whose backing repo had since been *deleted*, which made
`durableRef()` treat it as durable — nonexistence was coded as "never local,"
when it actually meant "the local copy is gone, which is exactly what durable
was supposed to rule out"; and a remote name containing `/` breaking a naive
`split("/")[0]` parse. At that point the fix stopped. The three findings were
recorded as known gaps (tracked in #537) rather than patched, on the reasoning
that a fourth clause would not be different in kind from the first three.

**Why stopping was the right call, not merely the disciplined one.** A
pre-registered flip condition from round 2's request said exactly this in
advance: *"if round 3 finds a third variant of the same question, that is a
signal the predicate is the wrong shape rather than incomplete."* Round 3
supplied three, and the request for round 4 was never sent — the loop's own
declared round budget (since gone in the #89 cut) was spent, so continuing
would have meant a self-serve
extension to patch a predicate already shown to be open-ended, which is a
worse trade than shipping the known gaps (the code being replaced was *more*
easily fooled than any of these three cases, by a plain uncommitted `HEAD`
with no adversarial setup at all — so shipping with the gaps recorded was
still a net hardening, not a regression). The better direction, named in #537
but not yet built: stop asking git locally and prove durability from the
GitHub snapshot this same module already captures for round-counting — an
externally-verified fact instead of an inference from configuration that can
be arranged, or simply happen, in ways nobody enumerated.

**Avoid:**

1. **When a check must know something is true of the outside world, ask
   whether the check can observe that world directly** (an API response, a
   captured snapshot) instead of inferring it from a local proxy that is
   merely correlated with it. Local git config predicts durability; it is not
   durability.
2. **Count counterexamples per predicate, per round, not just findings per
   round.** A stopping rule keyed to the total finding count can mask this —
   3 findings against 3 *different* predicates is ordinary review; 3 findings
   against the *same* predicate in one round is the open-surface signal, and
   it can hide inside a total that looks unremarkable.
3. **Pre-register the stopping threshold before the round that might trip
   it**, the way #531's round-2 request did. Deciding "three is too many" in
   the moment invites arguing yourself out of it; deciding it in advance and
   then finding the round confirms it is a different, harder-to-rationalize
   position to be in.

**Related:** *A "durable" or "committed" check that proves a proxy, not the
property* above is the single-clause version of this same mistake; this entry
is what happens when the fix for that one is itself built on another local
proxy. *A persistent counter of state the source of truth already holds* is
the sibling failure at the opposite end — there the check under-trusted the
authoritative source and kept a redundant local copy; here it over-trusts a
local proxy for a property only the outside world can confirm.

## An observable scoped to the mechanism you had in mind, not the harm you were watching for

**Looks like:** you do the disciplined thing. You write the stopping condition as
an observable rather than a judgement, exactly as the rule demands. Or you scope
a decline to a class rather than to the reviewer's example, exactly as the other
rule demands. Then the thing you were guarding against happens in a form your
words do not cover, and the guard sits there not firing while being, on its own
terms, correctly evaluated.

**These are one failure in two layers.** A fix scoped to the example and a flip
condition scoped to the example are the same error — the words name the shape
that was in your head, and the shape that arrives is a sibling of it. The
observable rule and the class rule both survive intact; what neither of them
supplies is the step where you ask *what is the harm, and what else produces it?*

**The worked examples, all from AI-Handbook #124.** Three flip conditions in one
pull request had their wording and their intent pull apart:

- **Round 2.** *"Three or more findings landing on the corrections themselves"* —
  counted two mechanically, and a defensible stricter reading counted three. Both
  readings happened to agree the batch was sound, so nothing turned on it. Luck.
- **Round 4.** *"Any finding that the new check can pass while the thing it checks
  is broken"* — satisfied by **every check that has ever been written**, since a
  stated-limits paragraph is a list of exactly that. A condition satisfied by
  everything selects nothing, and it fired on a coverage gap it was not aimed at.
- **Round 5.** *"Any finding that an **assessment** which should be allowed is now
  refused"* — the thing refused was a *scope exchange*. The intent covered it
  plainly; one noun kept it from tripping. Its instruction was "go to David",
  which is where the question went anyway — again by luck, not by drafting.

And the same error one layer down, in the same pull request: a fix that gave
Claude's package record its own path stopped one role overwriting the other's,
and left the *default* role overwriting it — because the fix was scoped to the
role in the finding rather than to the mechanism. That was written one round
after the builder recorded the class-not-example rule against himself.

**Avoid:**

1. **Write the observable, and write the harm beside it, in the same sentence.**
   "Three or more findings on lines this batch wrote — the signal being that the
   batch itself went wrong." The observable still decides; the harm is what tells
   you, at evaluation time, whether you are looking at the thing you meant.
2. **Before writing either kind of scope, name one sibling.** Not an exhaustive
   enumeration — one. If the condition or the fix does not cover the sibling, the
   wording is scoped to your example. The three cases above all had an obvious
   sibling: findings on a correction's *missed twin*, a check that covers one
   *layout*, an exchange that is not an *assessment*.
3. **When the two disagree, that disagreement is the finding.** Record it, fix
   the wording, and do not take whichever reading is more convenient. Three times
   in one pull request the destination survived a bad reading by luck; that is
   not a record to build on.
4. **Have someone else evaluate it.** Every one of these was surfaced by an
   independent assessor or a translator reading the same words, never by the
   person who wrote them. The author of a condition is its worst reader.

**Related:** *A guard that encodes the shape that occurred, and calls it a class*
above is this same error in code rather than in prose, and *A decline scoped to
the reviewer's example instead of the finding's class* below is its third face.
The fact that it has three entries in this file is itself the finding.

## A stopping condition used as a triage rubric

**Looks like:** you pre-register a flip condition before a review round — an
observable that says when the loop should stop. The round returns a finding.
You check it against the condition, it does not trip, and you read that as
*"below my bar for fixing."* The step between those two readings is the error:
**the complement of a stopping condition is not a decline list.**

**Why this is not the entry above.** *A pre-registered condition scoped to the
mechanism you had in mind* is about a condition whose **words** named one shape
and whose sibling arrived instead — it miscopes, and its first avoidance step
(name one sibling) catches it. Here the condition evaluates **correctly**
against the harm it names. The harm is simply not the question being asked of
it, so there is no sibling to name and that step does not fire. One is a
drafting failure; this is a category error about what the device is for.

**It runs in both directions, and each has its own cost.** A stopping rule read
as a triage rule **declines too much**: applied consistently it declines every
finding in every round that does not happen to end the loop, which is a decline
quota rebuilt out of a stopping rule — the exact shape AI-Handbook #96 retired.
A triage rule read as a stopping rule **writes too much**: "this is worth
fixing" authorises the *fix*, never the *round*, and treating it as though it
settled the round's cost buys a full write-gate round for a change nobody
needed.

**The worked examples, both from AI-Handbook #124.**

- **Round 7, declining too much.** A finding naming an incomplete oracle
  requirement — a fleet-wide instruction still cancelling the delegation the
  whole pull request existed to grant — was nearly declined on the grounds that
  it did not trip the stopping rule pre-registered for that round. Both
  assessors named it independently and from different directions. Fable: *"A
  pre-registered flip condition is a device for stopping a loop. It was never a
  triage rubric."* Astra, which is the sharper statement of why it cannot be
  allowed to work that way: *"Pre-registering that narrower rule does not
  authorise narrowing David's requirements."*
- **Round 14, writing too much — seven rounds later, same pull request.** A
  triage rule ("a false sentence is a write") was invoked as though it bound
  like a stopping rule, and bought a full round for a two-sentence change. The
  round translation caught it; the builder did not.

That both faces appeared in one loop, after the first had already been named in
its own thread, is the measure of how easily the two devices swap places in
one's own favour.

**Avoid:**

1. **Keep the two apart by the question each answers.** A stopping rule answers
   *"is this loop still worth running?"* A triage rule answers *"is this finding
   worth writing code for?"* Neither answers the other's question, and a
   stopping rule's complement answers nothing at all.
2. **A finding that does not trip a stopping condition has received no
   disposition.** It is still owed the Worth rule
   ([`review-judgment.md`](review-judgment.md)), in full, on its own merits.
3. **A triage rule that says "write" has not said "and a round for it is worth
   paying".** That is the ship gate's question and the Worth rule's, asked about
   the round rather than the fix.
4. **Say which device you are invoking, by name, in the reply that invokes it.**
   Both errors above were invisible while the reasoning stayed unnamed and
   obvious the moment it was written down for someone else.

**Related:** [`review-judgment.md`](review-judgment.md) is the only statement of
the triage rule; *A pre-registered condition scoped to the mechanism you had in
mind, not the harm you were watching for* above is the adjacent-but-distinct
drafting failure, and folding the two together is how this one goes back to
being invisible.

## Building a second validator beside an existing one re-derives its gaps, not its answers

**Looks like:** the repo already has a script that reads some external system,
validates the response and decides something from it. You need a second one for
a neighbouring decision, so you write it — reusing the obviously-shared helpers
and writing fresh everything else. Review then finds, one at a time, the
defects the first script had already found and fixed years or weeks ago.

**The worked example.** scripts/review-budget.mjs (PR #503) and
scripts/pr-ready.mjs (PR #490) — both since retired in the #89 cut — were built within days of each other, both
gating an action on a captured `pull_request_read` snapshot. Review of the
second independently re-found: **snapshots must be bound to the repository, not
just the PR number** (every repo has a #503); **receipt freshness must measure
when the external system was read, not when the command ran**, or a saved
snapshot mints an indefinitely renewable receipt; **reviewer logins must be
excluded from "pending" detection**, which `pr-ready` already did; and **an id
must be validated as a non-empty string or finite number**, since `!== undefined`
lets `null` through into a dedupe key. Each landed as a review finding rather
than as inherited code.

**Why sharing helpers isn't enough.** `review-budget.mjs` *did* reuse
the loop-metrics script's counting functions — deliberately, and that part worked.
What did not transfer was the **validation posture**: the accumulated list of
ways the snapshot can be wrong, which lives in neither a function nor a
comment but in the shape of the older script's checks. Reuse moves answers;
it does not move the questions somebody already learned to ask.

**Avoid:** before writing a second consumer of an external system, **read the
first one's validation block end to end and account for every check** — adopt
it, or write down why it doesn't apply here. That is a ten-minute read against
a review round per omission. If the two are close enough, extract the
validation itself rather than the counting, which is the half that was actually
hard-won.

## A decline scoped to the reviewer's example instead of the finding's class

**The pattern.** Triage weighs a finding's consequence and finds it small, so
the finding ships as a recorded gap. But the consequence that was weighed is
the one the *reviewer's example* reaches, not the one the *class* reaches — and
a reviewer picks whichever instance it happened to see, not the worst one. The
decline then reads as careful engineering while resting on a boundary nobody
drew deliberately.

This is the specific way a worth-based triage rule fails. The rule itself is
sound and exists because, under a write-gate, every fix costs a full review
round; what makes it dangerous is that mis-scoping the consequence is
indistinguishable, in the moment and in the written reply, from applying it
correctly.

**The worked example (AI-Handbook #73).** Round 3 reported that
`fable-dispatch.mjs` — since deleted, #95 — checked its `--out` path
*lexically*, so a symlinked component could put the receipt outside the
repository. The decline weighed
that as *"what escapes is a single gitignored receipt JSON written to a
directory I chose by hand"* — likelihood near zero, consequence trivial — and
it shipped as a gap over an oracle that had genuinely been run.

Round 4 returned the same class without the symlink: `--out .git/HEAD` is
inside the repository, passes the containment check, and `writeFileSync`
**truncates it**. Same code, same class, a destroyed checkout instead of a
misplaced JSON. The question the triage answered was *where does the file
land*; the question the class asked was *what does this write destroy*. Nothing
about the reported instance hinted at the second one, which is the point.

**Avoid:** state the class before the consequence, then answer the consequence
*of that class at its worst*, not of the example in front of you. (This used to
name the `Worth:` line of a fixed four-line reply form; the form was retired on
2026-09-17 and the discipline was not.) The tell is a decline whose consequence clause quotes details
specific to the reviewer's scenario — "gitignored", "one directory over", "a
file I chose by hand". Those are properties of the example. Strip them and ask
what remains reachable. And re-examine a class the reviewer raises a second
time on its new evidence and scope, naming what the new instance shows that the
first did not. **Repetition alone does not establish that the earlier judgement
was wrong** (David, 2026-09-17): the rule used to say it did, which turned any
persistent reviewer into an override.
