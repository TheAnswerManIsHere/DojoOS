## Why this exists

David runs ~10 concurrent sessions and cannot tell where any of them stand,
or which need him, without opening each one. This closes that gap using
GitHub's own project management rather than a bespoke tracker: **one issue
per workstream**, a private Project board for visual scanning (each repo's
board is named in its own `CLAUDE.md` overlay; the sync workflow takes it as
`PROJECT_OWNER`/`PROJECT_NUMBER` rather than hardcoding one), and a `/status-all` skill for the judgment the board can't
compute on its own (stall detection, plain-language restatement of what a
David-gate is actually asking).

## The lifecycle

Discovery → 🛑 Scope of work → Planning → 🛑 Plan approval → Coding →
Code review → Merge → Test run → 🛑 UAT → Close-out → Done

Bug-fixing mode (`/bugfix`) branches straight from Discovery to Coding,
skipping Planning and Plan approval — it still lands in Code review, Merge,
Test run, and UAT like everything else. A feature David has declared
prototype phase runs Discovery, Planning and Plan approval for its first
version, then enters Coding and stays there, alternating between his
feedback and the next version, with no Code review, Test run or UAT until
it flips (*Promotion is a real operation*, below; the rule is
[`working-modes.md`](working-modes.md#the-prototype-phase-per-feature-david-2026-09-26)).

🛑 marks a **David-gate** — a stage only he can move past. It's the same
glyph used for the mid-task interruption banner in chat, deliberately: one
symbol means "David," everywhere, not only in conversation. **Merge stopped
being a David-gate on 2026-08-15** (the agent driving the PR merges it once
the close-out bar in CLAUDE.md is met — for the standard loop, CI green, the
reviewer's pass returned for the head commit, every thread resolved, the owed
translations delivered; the two classes and the prototype phase carry their
own bars there),
and the **scope-of-work gate** was added
the same day at the front of Planning (see
[`working-modes.md`](./working-modes.md#the-scope-of-work-gate-david-2026-08-15)).
The last exception — a PR that widens the agent's own guardrails or
authority — was retired on 2026-09-14; nothing holds Merge as a David-gate.
**Known interim mismatch:** the Project board's verbatim Status option is
still named `🛑 Merge` (the sync script maps labels onto the board's exact
option names, and renaming an option is a board-config edit only David can
make, paired with a `sync-project-fields.mjs` + fixture code change) — so
until that follow-up lands, ordinary self-merged workstreams passing
through `stage:merge` briefly display the stop glyph on the board without
meaning "needs David." The label semantics in this doc are the truth;
`waiting:david` no longer occurs at Merge at all.

## Phased features: a parent issue, one sub-issue per phase

Some features are too large for one PR — PR #293 discovered this mid-flight
and self-documented as "phase 1 of 8," with no structural place to record
what the other seven were. The design settled 2026-08-05 and is built as of
2026-08-15:

- **The parent issue carries the plan** and the checkpoints that only make
  sense once for the whole feature: 🛑 Plan approval and close-out. It
  holds `mode:feature` and a **Phases checklist** (below). There is no
  separate whole-feature UAT gate — the next bullet is why.
- **Each phase is a GitHub sub-issue** of that parent (the native sub-issue
  relationship, the same one `/document` harvests use), with its own
  `stage:`/`waiting:`/`mode:` labels, its own PR carrying
  `Workstream: #<phase-issue>`, and its own merge.
- **Phases merge sequentially, never stacked.** No phase PR bases on
  another still-open phase PR. Phases don't need stacked-branch mechanics
  if they land one at a time, and this repo's force-push posture is a
  reason not to reach for them.
- **UAT is per-phase, and that's the only UAT there is.** Wherever a phase
  is itself product-visible it ships its own UAT doc — never one deferred
  to the final phase, which would leave David unable to verify anything for
  weeks. There is no separate whole-feature UAT step layered on top: no PR
  belongs to the parent for such a doc to be named after, and per-phase
  verification already covers the feature by the time the last phase
  closes.
- **A phase PR's oracle section carries a scope line** naming which of the
  parent plan's sections that phase delivers and which it defers, so a
  reviewer is never left guessing whether a missing piece is
  out-of-scope-for-this-phase or silently dropped.
- **Splitting a feature into phases is proposed to David, never declared
  silently mid-build.** (His stated revisit condition: if the asking step
  becomes friction in practice.)

### The Phases checklist

The parent issue's body carries this block, immediately after its State of
Play. It is the durable record of what the whole feature owes — the thing
that lived only in PR titles and chat memory before:

```
## Phases
- [x] Phase 1 — schema + migration → #451 (merged, PR #293)
- [x] Phase 2 — ISPWS client + XML builders → #452 (merged, PR #349)
- [ ] Phase 4 — provenance capture in quarantine.ts → #455 (active)
- [ ] Phase 5 — submission worker + reconciler → not yet opened
```

Each line is one phase: a checkbox, `Phase N`, a short description, and
either its sub-issue number or the literal `not yet opened`. A phase with
no issue yet is **normal and expected** — issues are opened as phases
start, not all upfront, so the checklist is the only place a
not-yet-started phase exists at all. `/next` reads exactly this to answer
"what's the next phase of something we already started," so a phase
missing from the checklist is a phase the system will forget.

**Parent labels while phases run.** The parent sits at `stage:coding`
from the first phase opening until the last phase closes, and its
`waiting:` mirrors whoever holds the **active** phase — at every `waiting:`
toggle on the active phase's PR, not just at that phase's close-out, so the
parent never displays a stale holder mid-review. When no phase is active
but phases remain, the parent is `waiting:claude` — that's an unstarted
next phase, which is work, not a resting state. Once every phase is
checked off, the parent moves straight to `stage:close-out` and is closed
out in the same pass (*Closing an issue*, below) — there is no
separate whole-feature UAT stage to pass through first, since per-phase UAT
already verified the feature as it shipped.

**Sub-issues are never double-counted.** `/status-all` already removes
every issue returned by `get_sub_issues` from its top-level set and
renders it nested under its parent; phase sub-issues inherit that
handling unchanged, and `/next` applies the same dedup.

## The backlog: work that's queued but hasn't started

A workstream issue tracks work that is *underway*. Work we've decided to do
but haven't started needs somewhere durable too — otherwise it lives in
roadmap prose, which drifts, and in David's memory, which he has explicitly
said not to rely on. So:

**A backlog item is an issue carrying `queue:` and `mode:` labels and no
`stage:` label.** The two prefixes are mutually exclusive and that's the
whole state machine:

- **`queue:`, no `stage:`** — decided, not started. Invisible to
  `/status-all` by construction (its Step 1 filters to issues carrying a
  `stage:` label), which is correct: the all-sessions view is about active work,
  and padding it with the backlog would bury the things that actually need
  someone. Don't "fix" that filter.
- **The moment work starts** — the item gains `stage:`/`waiting:` and
  **drops its `queue:` label**. It is now an ordinary workstream issue and
  every existing rule applies unchanged.

**Promotion is a real operation, not an implicit side effect of "work
starts."** Whichever skill is the one that first opens or reuses a
workstream issue for a given piece of work — `plan-review-loop` for a
phased or unphased feature plan, `bugfix` for a fix, `prototype` for a
feature David has declared prototype phase, from its first version's
approval onward (that version's issue is opened by `plan-review-loop` at
`stage:planning`, like any feature's) — owns performing it,
and does so **before** creating a fresh issue. **A prototype-phase feature
reaches `stage:coding` / `waiting:claude` on its first version's approval**
(and again on the approval of any later version David asked a loop for),
and until a version David can use exists, the agent is the
holder. It moves to `waiting:david` when a usable version is delivered (on
`main`, or on the prototype environment) and back to `waiting:claude` when
his feedback starts another revision, so the board asks him to act only
while there is something to act on. Its issue names the questions file and,
in the branch regime, the `prototype/<feature>` branch; its PR, where one
exists, carries `Workstream: #N` like any other; no `stage:code-review` ever
follows, because no code-review loop runs on any version. **The flip is a relabel of the same issue,
performed by the `prototype` skill before `plan-review-loop` starts**: it
first lands the registry change on `main` (the entry reads production, by a
one-line `Refs #N` PR that moves no label), then
locates the feature's issue by its `Workstream:` line or title, moves it to
`stage:planning` / `waiting:david`, and records the declaration in the
State of Play — so the planning loop finds an issue already at
`stage:planning` and reuses it rather than opening a second one, and the
feature has one issue across both phases. **A later prototype version
David asks a loop for takes the same relabel**, minus the registry change:
the `prototype` skill moves the feature's existing issue from `stage:coding`
to `stage:planning` / `waiting:david` before `plan-review-loop` starts, the
loop reuses it, and his approval returns it to `stage:coding`. The rule is
working-modes.md, *The prototype phase, per feature*:

1. **Search first**: does an open issue already carry `queue:` and
   describe this work (`search_issues`, title/body match, or David names
   it directly — e.g. "let's build the thing we queued")? If yes, that
   issue **is** the workstream issue — reuse it, don't open a second one.
2. **Promote it**: remove the `queue:` label, add the full `stage:`/
   `waiting:` set for wherever this skill is entering the lifecycle
   (`stage:planning` for a feature plan, a prototype's first version
   included; `stage:coding` for a bugfix, or for a prototype-phase feature
   after that approval, at `waiting:claude`), and
   write the State of Play block fresh (the backlog body's nuance carries
   forward as narrative, not as a field to preserve verbatim).
3. **Only if no matching backlog issue exists** does the normal fresh-issue
   path apply.

Skipping the search silently duplicates the issue instead — a new
workstream issue opens for work the backlog already tracked, the old
`queue:` issue is orphaned open forever, and `/next` can end up presenting
both as if they were independent.

Priorities are three labels, deliberately not named P1/P2 (that collides
with Codex's severity badges):

| Label | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `queue:now` | Next up. Would start today if a session were free. |
| `queue:next` | Committed, not immediate. The normal state for approved-but-unstarted work. |
| `queue:later` | Real, wanted, no urgency. Revisit rather than schedule. |

**The issue body is where nuance lives** — why we want it, what we already
decided, what we explicitly ruled out. That's the half a roadmap bullet
loses, and the half that makes an item resumable cold months later.

**This does not replace the two prose backlogs.**
the repo's roadmap stays the product narrative and
[`deferred-work.md`](../engineering/deferred-work.md) stays the engineering
one. A backlog issue is what gets created when something in either becomes
a *specific, actionable unit of work* — not a mirror of every line in them.
`/maintenance`'s backlog-hygiene step is what keeps the three from drifting.

## `Blocked by: #N` — dependencies are mechanical, not remembered

Any workstream or backlog issue may carry one or more lines in its body:

```
Blocked by: #422
Blocked by: #405
```

Read with the anchored regex `^Blocked by:[ \t]*#(\d+)` (multiline,
start-of-line), exactly like the `Workstream: #N` marker and for the same
reason: an unanchored `\s*` can cross a newline and grab an unrelated `#N`
from prose several lines later, or match an example inside a quoted plan.

- **An open blocker makes an item non-actionable.** Nothing recommends it,
  nothing starts it.
- **Closing the blocker releases it mechanically** — no cleanup edit
  required for the release itself, because the marker points at an issue
  whose state is the truth. (Removing the stale line is still good hygiene;
  `/maintenance` sweeps for them.)
- **There is no inverse `Blocks:` marker.** It's derivable, and a
  bidirectional convention is one that can disagree with itself.
- **Only trust markers on issues carrying our own labels.** This repo is
  public and anyone can open an issue, but outside accounts cannot apply
  labels — so an issue with no `stage:` and no `queue:` label is not part
  of this system and its markers are ignored. Same trust posture
  `/status-all` applies to PR bodies.

## When UAT finds a bug: the descent stack

This is the shape David hits most often, and the one this whole system
exists to survive: he starts UAT on a merged feature, hits an error, and
the error turns out to be a real bug — sometimes a small one, sometimes an
entire subsystem rebuild. (PR #213's private-meme UAT is the worked
example: it surfaced what became the whole admin-permission rebuild, #405
and #422.) Pre-launch, chasing those is deliberate — we're moving the product to
launch-ready — so the risk isn't chasing them, it's
**losing the way back to the interrupted UAT**.

The `Blocked by:` chain *is* the record of the way back — a call stack made
of issue links, which survives any session ending:

1. **On discovery**, whoever intakes the bug (bugfix mode, or feature mode
   when the rabbit hole turns out to be a rebuild) opens the new issue
   **and** adds `Blocked by: #new` to the interrupted workstream, plus one
   line in its State of Play recording **which UAT step failed**. That last
   detail is what makes resumption "resume at step 4" instead of "run the
   whole thing again."
2. **Depth is unbounded.** If the descent hits its own blocker, the chain
   nests. Nothing needs to know how deep it is.
3. **Priority propagates down the chain: an item inherits the highest rank
   of anything transitively blocked on it.** An interrupted UAT sits near
   the end of the lifecycle, so it ranks high — and that rank flows down to
   whatever is at the bottom of its chain. This is why a three-levels-deep
   permission rebuild correctly outranks starting any fresh feature:
   finishing it is what unwinds the stack back to an almost-done UAT.
4. **The stack pops mechanically.** When a blocker closes, its parent
   becomes actionable again and surfaces immediately as the top
   recommendation — "resume UAT on #213 at step 4."

**The escape hatch, because a deep stack can pin the queue for weeks.**
That's correct behavior pre-launch, but not unconditionally: if a descent
outgrows what the interrupted UAT is worth, David can park it. The marker
becomes `Parked, was blocking: #213` — which reads as prose, not as the
anchored `Blocked by:` marker, so it stops gating automatically — and the
interrupted workstream records its UAT as accepted-incomplete.
`/maintenance` flags any chain deeper than 2, or any blocker older than two
weeks, so that call gets *prompted* rather than remembered.

## The State of Play block

Labels are machine-readable state; the **State of Play block** is the
human-readable narrative that makes an issue resumable **cold**, in a fresh
session with zero prior context. It's a fixed section maintained at the top
of the workstream issue's body, with these fields:

- **Stage** — mirrors the `stage:` label, spelled out.
- **Waiting on** — mirrors the `waiting:` label, spelled out.
- **Last movement** — date + one-line description of what last happened.
- **What this is** — a few sentences of orientation; what the workstream
  actually accomplishes and why.
- **Where it actually stands** — the real narrative: what's landed, what
  hasn't, anything that broke and how it was fixed. Not a checklist for its
  own sake — enough that a cold reader understands the current shape.
- **What's blocking** — if `waiting` is `david`, the actual question,
  restated in plain language from the real thread, not inferred from the
  stage name alone (the same accuracy bar `/status-all` applies). If nothing's
  blocking, say so.
- **What you need to do** — the concrete next action, or "nothing right now."
- **Artifacts** — PR numbers, branch names, key file paths, the Project link.
- **To resume** — the literal instruction for picking this back up: which
  branch/session to open, what to ask for, which model tier fits.

**Whoever changes an issue's `stage:` or `waiting:` label updates this block
in the same edit** — the two must never drift apart, since a label with a
stale narrative behind it is worse than an honest gap. That means the same
skills that own label transitions
(`plan-review-loop`, `bugfix`, `prototype`, `pr-watch`, `pr-docs`, `/uat`)
own keeping this block current at those same trigger points. There is no
separate maintainer beyond those six **for label-driven updates**.

**Exactly two writers update this block without any label change:
`/handoff` and `/uat`.** `/handoff`
(`.claude/skills/handoff/SKILL.md`, Claude-only): when a session's context is
moved to a fresh session, the narrative changes while `stage:` and `waiting:`
deliberately do not — the holder is `claude` before and after, and a handoff
is not a lifecycle transition. `/uat`
([`.claude/skills/uat/SKILL.md`](../../.claude/skills/uat/SKILL.md)): a run
in progress changes what a cold reader needs to know (which step is next,
what setup is owed) while `stage:uat`/`waiting:david` stay exactly right,
so it maintains the body's `## UAT run` section and the `To resume` field
mid-run. Both are consistent with the rule above rather than exceptions to
it: the rule binds a label change to a block update, not the reverse. (The old fifth maintainer — the `test-run-completion.yml`
Action, which owned the deletion-of-a-TEST_RUN-doc transition — is retired
with the TEST_RUN file pattern, 2026-08-15: `pr-watch`'s close-out sequence
owns that transition now.)

## Labels are the actual source of truth

The Project board's `Status`/`Waiting On`/`Mode` fields are the *display*;
the issue's labels are what's actually true. **No available tool (MCP or
REST) can read or write a Projects v2 item field directly** — confirmed
twice, independently, building the sync mechanism (PR #318) and again
confirming `/status-all` has to read labels rather than the board (PR #323). A
`.github/workflows/project-sync.yml` Action
(`scripts/sync-project-fields.mjs`) mirrors labels onto the board's fields
on every label change. Nothing else writes to the board. (The retired
`test-run-completion.yml` Action was once a deliberate exception here —
its `GITHUB_TOKEN` label writes didn't cascade to `project-sync.yml`, so
it called `syncIssue` directly; with all label writes back in agent
sessions, that exception is gone.)

Every workstream issue carries exactly one label from each of three
prefixes:

- **`stage:<slug>`** — where it is in the lifecycle above. Slugs:
  `discovery`, `planning`, `plan-approval`, `coding`, `code-review`,
  `merge`, `test-run`, `uat`, `close-out`, `done`.
- **`waiting:<who>`** — who is currently holding it: `david`, `claude`,
  `codex`, `replit`, or `ci`. This is deliberately a **field separate from
  `stage`**, not folded into it — a blocking question mid-build leaves
  `stage` at `coding` while `waiting` flips to `david`. That divergence
  *is* the moment David needs surfaced, and collapsing the two fields
  would lose it.
- **`mode:<kind>`** — `feature`, `bugfix`, `docs`, or `devops`.

One label sits outside the three prefixes: **`gap`** marks a follow-up
issue filed from a review round for an imperfection accepted rather than
fixed — recorded to *revisit*, never a promise of future work. It is
filed with a `mode:` and **no `queue:`**, and never a `stage:`, since it
is not a workstream. **A gap with no `queue:` label is untriaged, and
untriaged gaps are invisible to `/next` by design** (David, 2026-09-28):
`/next` recommends only issues carrying a `queue:` or `stage:` label.
`/maintenance` step 9 asks now/next/never of every open `gap` issue by
label (#98); its answer is what gives a gap a `queue:` label, or closes it.
Like every label here, GitHub does not create it on first use — a
consumer creates it by hand once.

Two labels sharing a prefix (e.g. two `stage:` labels on one issue) is a
real data error, not a style nit — the sync script throws rather than
guessing which one wins (`labelsToFieldValues` in
`scripts/sync-project-fields.mjs`), and any agent hand-editing labels
should apply the same discipline: fix it, don't silently pick one.

## Whose job is it to keep labels current

**Nobody has a standing background job for this.** Each skill that already
has a natural trigger point updates the labels *at that point*, as part of
work it's already doing — not as a separate reminder to go check the board:

| Skill | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `plan-review-loop` | `waiting:claude` for the whole loop — a planning exchange is a local process the builder waits on, so there is no `waiting:codex` state; `stage:plan-approval` + `waiting:david` at the approval ask |
| `bugfix` | Opening the workstream at `stage:coding` directly (no Planning stage), `mode:bugfix` |
| `prototype` | The workstream from `stage:coding` / `waiting:claude` onward for a feature David has declared prototype phase (its first version's issue is opened at `stage:planning` by `plan-review-loop`, above), `mode:feature`; `waiting:david` when a usable version is delivered and back when his feedback starts a revision; the relabel to `stage:planning` / `waiting:david` before `plan-review-loop` starts, at the flip and for a later version David asked a loop for (*Promotion is a real operation*, above) |
| `pr-watch` | `stage:code-review` onward — round-by-round `waiting` toggling, `waiting:david` on escalation, `stage:test-run`/`waiting:replit` at merge when the PR's Post-merge verification section has real content (the close-out sequence then drives the checks and moves the label to `stage:uat`/`stage:close-out` once the checks pass); with "none needed" verification, the transition to `stage:uat`/`stage:close-out` still waits for the close-out sync checks (SHA match + clean worktree) to pass — never at the merge click itself, either branch. A workstream reaching `stage:close-out` this way (no UAT owed) goes on to `stage:done` and is closed in the same pass (*Closing an issue*, below). Also the labels on a follow-up issue it files from a review round: `gap` and the workstream's `mode:`, with no `queue:` until `/maintenance` triages it (#98; David, 2026-09-28) |
| `pr-docs` | No stage transition of its own — confirms `mode:feature` is right on the PR this pairing rides on |
| `/uat` | The exit from `stage:uat` — the one stage no agent could previously move, since only David could run it. `Accepted` and `Accepted with issues` both reach `stage:close-out` (his acceptance is what converts that run's bugs from blockers into independently-tracked work); a `Blocked` run holds at `stage:uat`. `waiting:claude` either way — the next real action is a fix or a close-out, not something David can click. An accepted run drives close-out through to `stage:done` and closes the issue. Also owns the `Blocked by:` + failed-step record at the moment a run finds a bug, executing `bugfix`'s intake contract earlier, while the context is still in front of it — but **not** the `waiting:` flip, which waits until the run actually stops, since a run David chooses to continue is still David-held |
| `/document` | A harvest is a **sub-issue** of the parent workstream (GitHub's native sub-issue relationship), not a status value on the parent — it has its own branch, PR, and review loop, so it needs its own row |

**Phase ownership rides the same trigger points**, with no new maintainer:

| Moment | Who | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| David approves a phased plan | `plan-review-loop` | Writes the **Phases checklist** into the parent issue, every phase listed, all `not yet opened`. Never opens a phase itself — its lifecycle ends at this approval handoff and doesn't run again for phase 2 onward. |
| A phase starts (every phase, including the first) | the product implementation skill | Opens that phase's sub-issue with its own full label set, links it under the parent, updates the checklist line from `not yet opened` to the issue number — this is the one place phase-opening lives, so phase 1 and phase 8 work the same way |
| A phase's PR is under active review (each `waiting:` toggle) | `pr-watch` | Mirrors the same toggle onto the **parent's** `waiting:`, in the same edit — a phased parent's `waiting:` tracks whoever holds the *active* phase at every step, not just at close-out |
| A phase's PR closes out | `pr-watch` | Ticks that phase's checkbox in the parent, and re-points the parent's `waiting:` at the next phase (`waiting:claude` if the next phase hasn't opened) |
| The last phase closes out | `pr-watch` | Moves the **parent** straight to `stage:close-out` and closes it out in the same pass (*Closing an issue*) — per-phase UAT already covered verification, so there is no separate whole-feature UAT gate to enter |
| **A phase that held at `stage:uat` is accepted** | **`/uat`** | The same two rows above, performed by `/uat` instead — tick the phase's checkbox, re-point the parent's `waiting:`, and, if this was the last phase, move the parent to `stage:close-out` and close it out in the same pass. `pr-watch` cannot: it finished when the PR merged, and a UAT acceptance is not a PR event, so nothing wakes it again. Without this the parent keeps a finished phase marked active and `/next` recommends it |

A phase sub-issue is a workstream issue like any other — it carries the
same three label prefixes and its own State of Play block, because a phase
is exactly the unit someone resumes cold.

Each skill's own file carries the concrete instruction at its trigger
point; this doc is the shared vocabulary they point back to, not a
restatement.

## Closing an issue

**Merge is not verification, and it is not the reason an issue stays
open either.** What keeps a merged workstream open is a UAT still owed —
or, for a feature David has declared prototype phase, the phase itself: its
merges have no close-out, its issue stays at `stage:coding` from its first
version's approval through every later version (back at `stage:planning`
only while a loop David asked for runs), and it closes at the
close-out of the hardening PR that follows
the flip — or, when David declares the feature abandoned, as *not planned*
once its teardown is confirmed (in the branch regime that may wait on
David's host step, and the issue stays open at `waiting:david` until then),
with a comment naming the
decision (*Promotion is a real operation*, above; the rule is
[`working-modes.md`](working-modes.md#the-prototype-phase-per-feature-david-2026-09-26)).
The one-line registry PRs the phase uses — at the start under the branch
regime, at the flip, at abandonment — say `Refs #N` and own no lifecycle. Where none is owed, nothing remains for anyone to
verify after the close-out sync, so the issue closes then. (David, 2026-09-25. Before this,
the only step that closed an issue was an accepted `/uat` run. Every
workstream with no UAT — every docs, devops and Tier A bugfix PR, and in
AI-Handbook nearly every PR — parked at `stage:close-out` with "David's to
set" `stage:done`, and nothing ever asked him to.)

- **Close-out is a moment, not a resting state.** Whoever moves a
  workstream to `stage:close-out` finishes what remains in it (the
  harvest-notes comment for a product feature, any item the State of Play
  lists), then sets `stage:done` and closes the issue as *completed*, in
  the same pass. The closing comment names the PR(s) that did the work. A
  workstream waits at `stage:close-out` only while a named item really
  cannot be finished now, and its State of Play names that item.
- **Who that is:** `pr-watch` when no UAT doc is owed (at the verified
  sync, per its transition), `/uat` on an accepted run, `pr-watch` or
  `/uat` for a phased parent when its last phase reaches close-out, and the
  `prototype` skill for a prototype-phase feature David declares abandoned
  (as *not planned*, above).
- **A product-visible change that shipped no UAT doc** (the Tier A case)
  still closes. The closing comment carries the one-line pointer the State
  of Play used to: where to look next time David is in the app, and to
  reopen the issue if the symptom persists. Reopening takes one click, so
  closing never loses the thread.
- **Other issues a PR completes outright** — a gap, backlog or bug issue
  that is not the PR's workstream and owes no UAT of its own — are named
  with `Closes #N` in the PR body, so GitHub closes them at merge. A PR that
  only *advances* such an issue says `Refs #N` and says what remains, on
  the issue. When a PR already merged without the keyword, the agent that
  notices closes the issue by hand, naming the PR.
- **An issue closed by mistake is reopened.** It is never left closed to
  save face; being able to reopen is what makes closing cheap.

## What must never happen

- **`Pull request merged → Done`, the Project's built-in workflow, stays
  off.** A merge is followed by Test run and UAT — or, for a prototype-phase
  PR, by his feedback at `stage:coding` — and the board must never
  claim work is verified before David has actually verified it. (Confirmed
  correct in practice: PR #311 merged and correctly stayed at `🛑 UAT`, not
  `Done`.)
- **`Auto-close issue` stays off**, for the same reason one step worse.
- **A PR body never says `Closes #N` for its own workstream** — it says
  `Workstream: #N`. Auto-closing at merge would skip UAT on the work that
  owes one, and the agent that reaches close-out closes the issue instead
  (*Closing an issue*, above). `Closes #N` is for a *different* issue the
  PR completes outright — see that section.
- **A workstream never rests at `stage:close-out` with nothing left in
  it.** An open issue whose work is finished is not neutral: `/next` and
  `/status-all` keep surfacing it, and it hides the issues that are really
  open.
- **Sensitive / disclosure-carve-out workstreams never become public
  issues.** They're draft Project items instead — this repo is public, and
  an issue body is public even though the Project itself is private. This
  is the **canonical definition** of the disclosure check that gates
  opening a public workstream issue, referenced (not restated) by
  `plan-review-loop` (which opens a prototype's first-version issue too), the
  `prototype` skill before a questions file or ledger's first push,
  `working-modes.md`'s bugfix disclosure check, and
  `documentation-workflow.md`'s harvest-tracking section: before a
  workstream — a plan, a bug report, or a `/document` harvest — becomes a
  public issue, confirm it contains none of unpatched-vulnerability
  details, auth/authorization bypass specifics, secrets/credentials,
  payment-fraud abuse paths, private customer/commercial data, or
  embargoed-plan content. If it does, it stays off the public path — a
  draft Project item, or (for a plan specifically) the manual/private
  review path instead of a plan-review PR.
- **No hand-typed GitHub UI name (a field, an option) gets matched by exact
  string in code.** The sync script's first live run against the real board
  failed all 9 workstream syncs because the real `Waiting On` field
  (capital O, typed by hand) didn't match a hardcoded `Waiting on`. See
  [`.agents/memory/github-project-field-names-need-normalized-matching.md`](../../.agents/memory/github-project-field-names-need-normalized-matching.md).
  Match by normalized name, not exact string, for anything a human typed
  into a GitHub UI.

## `/status`, `/status-all`, and `/next`

Three skills, three questions (`/status` split from `/status-all`
2026-08-05; `/next` added 2026-08-15). `/status-all` and `/next` answer only
for the repository the session is working in — each skill's *Scope* section
says how that is resolved:

- **`/status-all`** (`.claude/skills/status-all/SKILL.md`) — the
  **all-sessions** view of **the active repository only**, never other
  repositories (2026-09-25): every open workstream, grouped
  🛑 NEEDS YOU / ⚠️ STALLED / IN PROGRESS, recomputed directly from issues +
  labels + PR state (it can't read the Project board either, per the tooling
  gap above). **Read-only.** Works from any session, including a fresh
  throwaway one; that's the intended usage. See the skill file for the
  stall-detection threshold and the plain-language-blocker rule.
- **`/status`** (`.claude/skills/status/SKILL.md`) — **one session's own**
  workstream: what it's working on, which of five states it's in
  (`WORKING` / `WAITING ON YOU` / `WATCHING` / `STALLED` / `DONE`), what's
  next, and how it fits the roadmap.
- **`/next`** (`.claude/skills/next/SKILL.md`) — **what should we pick up
  now** in the active repository, ranked. The only one of the three that takes a position rather
  than reporting state. It reads everything above plus the backlog,
  `Blocked by:` chains, and Phases checklists, ranks by **closest to done
  wins** with rank inheriting down each blocked chain, and names which
  candidates are safe to run in parallel sessions. **Read-only**, like
  `/status-all` — it recommends, it never starts work or fixes tracking.

**The five states are a derived presentation vocabulary — never stored.**
They are computed from the `stage:`/`waiting:` labels plus live GitHub state.
They never become labels, never become board fields, and nothing reads them
back. Labels remain the sole source of truth.

**`/status` reports; it does not write unattended.** When stored labels or the
issue's `## State of Play` block disagree with live GitHub, it says so and
**offers** to correct them — David confirms, and only then does it write.
That keeps the ownership model in the table above intact: `/status` is not a
standing background writer, it is a David-confirmed correction at a moment he
is already present for. (An unattended write-through version was designed and
rejected — it needed conflict detection and write-target authentication the
GitHub API can't cleanly provide, for a status check. See
[`decisions.md`](./decisions.md).)

**`WATCHING` may never be claimed from memory** — only after a live check in
that same invocation. A session's belief that it is watching a PR goes stale
exactly the way issue #328's did.
