  SYNCED FILE — do not edit in a consumer repo.

  This file is the fleet-wide, cross-agent half of the routing constitution.
  It is maintained in the AI-Handbook repo and vendored into every consumer
  repo by the handbook sync. An edit made here in a consumer repo is
  overwritten by the next sync; change the handbook instead.

  Unlike CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md does not support eager file imports, so a
  consumer's AGENTS.md LINKS here rather than importing. That matches how
  AGENTS.md already works — it is a routing file whose job is to send an
  agent to the right document — but it means this file must be readable
  standalone, by an agent that arrived from a link with no other context.
  Write it that way.

  What belongs here: the cross-agent working agreement, planning and
  implementation standards, technical priorities, engineering principles.
  What belongs in the consumer's AGENTS.md: the product's context-reading
  routes, its subsystem map, and its setup/verification/CI commands.

## Working agreement with David

David is the product owner. **Do not implement major changes from a non-trivial
plan until David has explicitly approved that plan.** An ambiguous nudge or another
agent's approval is not David's approval. A feature David has declared
**prototype phase** has a short plan to approve for its **first version**
only; later versions have none unless he asks (below, and working-modes.md
*The prototype phase, per feature*). Full working rules:
[`docs/ai-context/agent-working-rules.md`](../../docs/ai-context/agent-working-rules.md).

**Two working modes — the ceremony in force is always visible, never silent.**
Default is **feature mode** (plan → approval → full build → PR). **Bugfix
mode** is a lightweight fix-and-commit path. For Codex, David turns it on by
saying so (e.g. a prompt starting **"Bugfix mode:"**); absent an explicit
signal you are in feature mode. (Claude routes by request shape with an
announced, vetoable classification — see the mode-entry section of
working-modes.md.) Read
[`docs/ai-context/working-modes.md`](../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md) for the full
contract of each and how to switch between them. **A feature also has a
phase, prototype or production, declared per feature in this repo's
`docs/ai-context/overlay-declarations.md`** (David, 2026-09-26): a change
touching only prototype-phase features is outside the code-review loop
(its first version still runs the planning loop), and a change touching any
production-phase feature is in the standard loop for the whole PR. The rule is working-modes.md, *The prototype phase, per feature*.

**End-of-feature documentation.** Follow
[`docs/ai-context/documentation-workflow.md`](../../docs/ai-context/documentation-workflow.md).
**The per-merge close-out judgement is retired (David, 2026-08-20)** — the
heavyweight harvest now runs **batched at `/maintenance`**, covering every
production-phase feature merged since the last pass (a prototype-phase
feature waits for its flip), or whenever David asks. What a production-phase
feature's close-out owes instead is cheap and unconditional: a **harvest-notes comment
on the feature's workstream issue** — decisions and why, alternatives
rejected, gotcha candidates — so the batched pass inherits the session's
context. Process PRs get no harvest. This is distinct from a one-off
"remember this" (immediate targeted persistence), which never waits for a
batch.

**Workstream tracking.** Every unit of work — feature, bugfix, ad-hoc doc
harvest (the batched harvest at `/maintenance` has none of its own) —
has a GitHub issue as its spine, tracked on a private Project board and kept
current via `stage:`/`waiting:`/`mode:` labels — with **two** exceptions.
*Sensitive/disclosure-carve-out work* never becomes a public issue and is a
private draft Project item instead. *David's Replit tweaks* — display-only UI
changes he makes himself during UAT — carry no issue of their own: like every
change to `main` since his ruling of 2026-10-03 (*"Yes, everything goes
through a pull request"*), each arrives as a pull request, and that PR is its
record. A tweak Replit commits on the Repl's own `main`, which the Repl tracks,
cannot be pushed, so Claude moves it to a branch through the connector and
opens the PR from there, never dropping it unless David says to. What reviewing one *finds* beyond the tweak is ordinary work and gets
an issue like anything else. Read
[`docs/ai-context/workstream-tracking.md`](../../docs/ai-context/workstream-tracking.md)
before opening or reviewing a PR — it covers the label conventions and what
must never happen (e.g. `Closes #N` for the PR's own workstream, which would
skip UAT), and when an issue is closed instead.

When asked to **plan**:
1. Inspect the repo first.
2. Identify source-of-truth boundaries.
3. Call out product ambiguities (ask David; don't guess intent).
4. Propose a phased plan.
5. Include tests and migration/backfill handling where relevant.

When asked to **implement** (an approved plan):
1. Re-read the approved plan + relevant `docs/ai-context/` files.
2. Confirm the affected files.
3. Make the smallest coherent change.
4. Run relevant tests.
5. Summarize what changed, what was tested, and what remains risky.

## Technical priorities

Prefer, in order:
1. Runtime correctness.
2. Durable data and source-of-truth boundaries.
3. Repository fit.
4. Migration and backfill safety.
5. Security, validation, permissions, and auditability.
6. Admin UX clarity.
7. Tests and regression protection.
8. Simplicity and scope control.
9. Observability and debuggability.

## Important product principles

- **Human-moderated decisions must not be silently overwritten by AI reprocessing.**
- **Runtime behavior must match admin preview and debug surfaces.**
- **Avoid duplicate sources of truth.**
- **Do not patch only the latest example — solve the general mechanism.**
- **A check earns its place only when the value can differ from what you
  intended — which requires something outside your control to have produced
  it.** A harness report, a network response, a real user, another program's
  output: observe those and refuse on disagreement. Everything a hand-run
  script gets from its own operator's argv falls into one of two kinds, and
  the rule differs:
  - **Derivable** — the script already holds every input needed to compute
    it (a receipt path from role and head). **Derive it; do not take it as
    input at all.** A check whose two sides you both own carries no
    independent information — it fails only when the code between them is
    wrong, and that code is exactly as likely to be wrong as the check
    (AI-Handbook #73: four review rounds on one flag, then the flag was
    deleted).
  - **A choice** — it encodes intent the script cannot know (`--role`,
    `--timeout`, `sync --to <repo>`). Take it. A cheap check that it is
    well-formed — non-empty, numeric where a number is expected, a path that
    exists — is catching the operator's own mistake, which is exactly the
    threat model, and stays. A defence against a *hostile* value of it — a
    planted symlink, a traversal, a hard link the operator would have to
    create on purpose — is not, and the response to such a finding is to
    decline it, not to guard (AI-Handbook #7: eleven findings and no added
    safety).
  **Ask who produced the value, never which directory the file sits in.** A
  script that parses a hook payload, a fetched document, a webhook body or
  another program's output is reading something it does not control, however
  local it looks — and where that script exists to *constrain* the producer,
  its input is adversarial by construction and validating it is the entire
  job. Getting this backwards disarms exactly the code that matters most.
  **And a consequence nobody would feel is not a consequence** (David,
  2026-09-11). Two classes follow, and findings in them are declined rather
  than fixed: **accounting precision**, where a miscount changes no decision
  — how many review rounds a loop ran is a gut-level trend, not an audit
  history, so machinery making such a count exact is pure cost; and **an
  agent's influence over its own tooling**, where the agent that runs a
  script is the only actor who could subvert its inputs and could equally
  just not run it. The controls against deliberate action are the
  server-side ruleset and the human working alongside, who reads the one
  line every authority-widening PR carries naming what latitude it grants
  (2026-09-14, when the human-merge gate was retired). Neither class is
  fixed because the diff would be small: each fix costs a review round, and the aggregate is never
  weighed at the moment one is chosen.
- **Prefer database-backed config for tunable operational settings.**
- **Migrations must be idempotent and observable.**
- **Async work must show status** at two altitudes (per-item + aggregate) — see
  [`docs/ai-context/async-ui-status.md`](../../docs/ai-context/async-ui-status.md).
- **Ship the surface with the behavior** (no dead UI, no invisible backend), and
  **enforce every permission server-side.**
- Pre-launch: features ship **on-by-default, no rollout flags** (the tester
  tier's configuration switch is not one — `agent-working-rules.md`, *No
  rollout-flag gating*); **no new external vendors** without David's sign-off.

## Planning standard

For non-trivial implementation work, create or update a plan using
[`.agents/PLANS.md`](../PLANS.md). **Do not begin implementation until David
approves the plan.** A feature in **prototype phase** meets this standard
once, for its first version — a short plan, Astra's review, David's
approval — and is outside it for later versions unless he asks; no version
gets a code review, and after the first the only reviewer is the product
owner using it
([`working-modes.md`](../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#the-prototype-phase-per-feature-david-2026-09-26)).

**Planning (not code review).** A planning loop does not run on a pull request
(2026-09-09), and since 2026-09-18 it is not a review: two parties develop the
plan together, one of them holding it. The plan reaches you as a **file in the
checkout you are running in**, named in the instructions you are given, with the
agreed oracle alongside.

[`planning-contract.md`](../../docs/ai-context/planning-contract.md) is the whole
authority. Both parties read it, and the facts that differ by role — who holds
the plan, who may settle a purely technical tie — arrive in the **role block**
the dispatch places above it. This paragraph deliberately does not summarise it:
the summary that used to sit here outlived the rules it summarised by a full
redesign, which is what a summary of a contract does.

What is worth stating outside the contract, because it binds whoever reads this
file: **no agent approves a plan, agreement between agents is not approval, and
neither party implements the work.** Only David approves.
