# Implementation Plan Template

> Use this template for **non-trivial** implementation work. **Do
> not begin implementation until David approves the plan** (explicitly, in words —
> see [`../docs/ai-context/agent-working-rules.md`](../docs/ai-context/agent-working-rules.md)).
> Trivial, well-scoped fixes don't need the full template; a "bug fix" that is
> really a behavior change does. A feature David has declared **prototype
> phase** gets a short plan for its **first version** only — the design
> question it exists to answer, the hypothesis it tries, the surface it shows,
> what it leaves out — reviewed by Astra and approved by David like any other;
> later versions get none unless he asks (working-modes.md, *The prototype
> phase, per feature*). **For that short plan, those four items are the whole
> plan**: it runs the Preflight's increment test — what this version makes
> true, what bounds it, how completion is recognised — and none of the other
> three checks, and none of the sections below apply to it. It is still
> written to `docs/plans/PLAN_<SLUG>.md`, so the loop's digest line works
> unchanged; a later version David asks a loop for gets the same short plan.

## Preflight: is this a plan, or a direction?

**Run the increment test before filling in anything below** —
[`../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md`](../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#the-increment-test)
defines it, and it asks what this increment makes true, what bounds it, and how
completion will be recognised. **Universal wording and independently shippable
phases are reasons to examine the boundary, never grounds for an automatic
split** (#124, 2026-09-18): a bounded requirement may legitimately hold across
many paths. Where the boundary is genuinely wrong, recommend the split and its
benefit — David decides changes to agreed scope. Scope that arrives *later* — during planning
or during review — is framed **now vs. next**, defaulting to **next** unless
this plan cannot be *correct* without it. Adding it because the end state
needs it is what the direction is for.

**Then, before drafting Problem/Direction below, run the affected-surface
inventory** —
[`working-modes.md`](../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#the-affected-surface-inventory-david-2026-08-13)
defines it. If this plan touches a *pattern* (a permission shape, a
derivation rule, a naming convention) rather than one call site, name the
class and write the mechanical oracle
(`git grep -n`, which searches the tracked set) that finds every instance
before scoping the plan — the hit list is what the plan's scope is drawn
from, not a recalled inventory. Note the oracle and its result as a Settled
Decision even when it finds nothing new.

**If the class genuinely cannot be mechanized** — a semantic pattern with no
searchable signature — record *that* as the Settled Decision and route the
scope call to judgment/escalation, exactly as the class-sweep protocol does
at fix time. What is not acceptable is running a nominal search that does not
find every instance and then claiming inventory-backed scope.

**Then, for every sentence claiming a set is complete, a behavior inert, or a
state unreachable, apply the claim-oracle rule** —
[`working-modes.md`](../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#a-completeness-claim-carries-its-oracle-or-it-is-not-a-claim-david-2026-08-25):
*where is this enforced?* Two answers satisfy it. An **oracle** — executed
against this revision, its real output recorded, and the plan stating how that
output maps to the claim; naming a search is not running one, and an output a
careful reader could sort two ways establishes nothing. Or a **construct** —
a predicate, type, schema constraint, or runtime refusal *in the shipped
system*; a table row in the plan is prose in a grid, not a construct. Anything
else ⇒ add the construct or write the property as an open uncertainty rather
than a Settled Decision. "Unsupported by convention" is not "unreachable by
construction" — say which one you have. Naming the mechanism in a clause
satisfies this without specifying it, which is what keeps it clear of the
specification test below. **A test is not a construct** — it detects rather
than prevents, so a property backed only by a future test is written as
*checked*, never as *cannot*.

**Then, for every line you write below, apply the specification test** —
[`working-modes.md`](../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#a-plan-specifies-invariants-not-implementation-david-2026-08-12):
*if the plan never mentioned this, what would catch it?* Compiler, test
suite, or diff review ⇒ leave it out; nothing ⇒ that is what this document is
for. State invariants, not call-site lists or test assertions. Keep full depth
on the four uncatchable categories: data model and migration shape, security
and privilege boundaries, sequencing between separate plans, and product
semantics.

## Problem
What problem are we solving? Include the concrete user/admin/runtime symptom.

## Direction
Which direction does this plan serve? Link it, and say in one sentence what
this increment makes true that wasn't true before. If there genuinely is no
direction — some work stands alone — say so explicitly rather than leaving
this blank.

## Product Intent
What outcome does David want? (If you're unsure of the intent, ask David before
planning further — don't guess.) State it as what **this increment** makes
true. The end state belongs in the Direction above, not here.

## Must Not Change
Invariants and out-of-scope behavior — what should explicitly stay the same.

## Settled Decisions
Decisions already made during the pre-plan conversation, and why (design
choices, trade-offs resolved before writing this plan). These four sections
— Direction, Product Intent, Must Not Change, Settled Decisions — are the
oracle a reviewer checks the eventual implementation PR against, verbatim
(see
[`docs/engineering/code-review.md`](../docs/engineering/code-review.md#the-review-oracle-the-pr-body)).

## Repo Context Inspected
List the actual files, modules, routes, schemas, tests, and docs you inspected.
Reference the relevant `docs/ai-context/*` files you read.

## Current Behavior
Describe what the repo does today (grounded in the code you inspected).

## Source-of-Truth Analysis
Identify the source of truth for **every** affected concept. Call out any duplicate
or conflicting sources of truth, and confirm you won't create a new one. (E.g.
`facts.*` is active enrichment truth; the Visual Concept is the authoritative
scene; the render-time plan/compiler is the prompt source of truth.)

## Proposed Design
Describe the target architecture and why it fits the existing repo.

## Data Model and Migration Impact
Does schema or stored data change? If yes, include migration/backfill/idempotency/
rollback/observability and the old/new/partial/failed/skipped/no-op row-state
matrix. (See `docs/engineering/migrations-and-backfills.md`.)

## Runtime Behavior
Describe behavior after the change, including edge cases.

## Admin/User UX Impact
Describe UI states, copy, and loading/empty/error/partial/skipped states. For
async work, specify the per-item + aggregate status surface. Note any moderation
implications.

## Security, Permissions, and Validation
Server-side checks, route protection (`requireAdmin`/`requireRole`), validation
schemas, and audit needs.

## Testing Plan
Automated tests + manual QA. Tests must prove the **general invariant**, not only
the reported example, with negative cases. Name the runner commands (see
`docs/tests/TESTING.md`).

## Implementation Steps
Break into small, ordered steps — the smallest coherent change that satisfies the
intent.

## Risks and Mitigations
Technical/product risks and how the implementation reduces them.

## Questions for David
Only questions that require product-owner judgment. Do **not** ask David questions
the repo can answer (resolve those yourself and note the resolution).

## Definition of Done
A concrete pass/fail checklist — including "the intended behavior can be exercised
in the product."
